She only wanted an outlet, a way to touch people\u2019s lives. To make them forget the worries of the world and just enjoy themselves, if only for a while.<br><br>With age came a new-found freedom. She bought a battered old Chevy truck and was able to travel around by herself, meeting fans and making new friends wherever she stopped. Hers wasn\u2019t a story of rock excess though: just the road, her guitar and maybe a good bourbon to end the day.<br><br>From sun-baked festivals to dark and cosy bars, people flocked to her voice and her self-penned songs of friendship, family, love and home.<br><br>These sentiments weren\u2019t just lip-service: she made sure to return home as often as she could, to help out in her community and entertain the local children with her tales of the wider world. She saw it as a way of giving back, of supporting others in the same way she had.<br><br>It was home where she found most of her inspiration as well. She had always loved to take long walks in the woods around her town, exploring off the beaten track, finding a quiet spot to play and write her songs. She had a favorite location she returned to time and again, a natural hollow, encircled by trees, that looked almost as if it had been blasted out of the rocks thousands of years ago.<br><br>Here she felt a strong connection to nature, and to the Earth itself. She let her mind be enveloped by the forest and it rewarded her with constant inspiration.<br><br>She picked up her guitar and played, her fingers dancing across the fretboard. The music that she made this time was unlike her usual uplifting tunes, being much more melancholy, even dark. Still, something compelled her to continue, to finish the song.<br><br>Around her, the leaves vibrated in unison with the guitar strings and the boughs of the trees lengthened, coalescing into a living form. Spider-like legs descended from the canopy above, grasping for her. Regaining her senses, she grabbed a rock and tried to beat them back, but their skin was as hard as iron and the rock simply bounced off and skittered away.<br><br>The legs coiled like tendrils around her limbs and lifted her towards the darkness overhead. Fog rolled across the clearing, obscuring both Kate and the creature of nightmares that drew her up towards itself.<br><br>When the fog cleared, there was no sign of any struggle, or of life. Just an acoustic guitar, the scratch plate engraved with flowers; as well as the initials KD, inlaid in mother of pearl.",

He devoured all the information he could, on shared dream worlds, lucid dreaming, and the methods to control the dream space. Forcing himself to stay awake, via a steady diet of pills and energy drinks, he searched through dusty volumes, finding myths about the demons that live in dreams, trapping their victims in limbo and feeding off their terror.<br><br>He worked quickly as he knew that Freddy would soon be coming for him.<br><br>It wasn\u2019t long before that moment arrived and Freddy began appearing in his dreams.

He tested this skill carefully, not wanting to show his hand, hoping that it would give him some kind of advantage that he could use to defeat Freddy.<br><br>Then, one night, he found himself in the familiar environment of Badham Preschool.

He found a can of paint thinner and quickly formulated a plan.<br><br>Once the trap was set, he waited, acting as the lure to draw Freddy into the right position. And there he was, claws scraping on metal as he closed in for the kill.<br><br>Quentin allowed himself time to enjoy the surprise on Freddy\u2019s face as the corridor ignited and then he was away, running through the building, heading for the exit that he knew existed. If he harried Freddy, weakening him and then escaping the dream to safety, surely that would defeat him over time?<br><br>Before his eyes, the cracks in the dream closed and his escape route was blocked. He was in Freddy\u2019s secret room again, and there was nowhere to run.<br><br>As Freddy closed in, a broad grin spreading across his ruined face, Quentin was consumed by a need to see this man finally obliterated. He wished it had been him, not his father, who threw the gas can that ended Krueger\u2019s life, that it had been him who cut Freddy\u2019s throat. Perhaps that desire would be enough? This was a realm of the mind after all.<br><br>He let it consume him, concentrating all his thoughts on wishing Freddy gone.<br><br>His vision was obscured with roiling tendrils of fog and, when it cleared, he was somewhere else. In another dream? If so, it wasn\u2019t his; it felt cold and unfamiliar.<br><br>A flickering drew his attention and he realized he was by a campfire, and he wasn\u2019t alone.

He had a steady diet of long commutes, grading piles, nightly lesson plans, and early classes. After a year, he managed to apply for a position abroad. His first plane ride took him to Southern Japan for a new start.<br><br>His life in Kagoshima was hectic. There was little time to do everything he took for granted back home. His Japanese was elementary at best, which slowed him down. Buying groceries took hours, long commutes had to be planned, and lesson plans relied on Japanese notions, which he had to learn.<br><br>But after a few months, he found his rhythm. He reflected on it one morning while riding the train to work. He no longer had to study the kanji characters filling the map. He knew his way. His language skills had improved, he felt connected to his students, and he\u2019d treat himself to luxurious restaurants on weekends. He even had his first vacation planned.<br><br>Within seconds, Adam\u2019s world was brought down to a slow motion. Rails hissed, bags came pouring down, and the floor trembled before the hit: Adam crashed forward as the train flipped upside down.

		"story": "Jeff Johansen was born and raised in Ormond, Alberta. He grew up as a quiet, only child with an aversion for large crowds. During high school, his anxious nature was mislabelled as shyness, which he covered up with a tough, stoic persona that intimidated bullies and teachers alike. At home, he discovered an interest for heavy metal and started a vinyl collection. The evocative symbolism on the covers inspired him to make some art of his own, which helped him cope with his parents\u2019 constant fighting.<br><br>To escape his parents\u2019 increasingly recurrent blow-ups, Jeff started working at a video store. Few customers passed by, so he had a lot of free time to draw. A late-night regular noticed his sketches and asked him to do some artwork for his gang at the abandoned lodge up Mount Ormond. Jeff accepted the challenge and painted a large mural depicting \u201cThe Legion\u201d in runny, bloody letters. He was given a fifty-dollar bill and a 12-pack for his hard work. It was his first paid commission, a milestone to be proud of.<br><br>After his parents\u2019 divorce, Jeff was forced to move with his mother to Winkler, Manitoba, which was miles away from his hometown\u2014and his dad. In Winkler, Jeff was more isolated than ever, except for art and music. His solace came shortly after graduating high school when he started working at a local bar with live music performances. He found a roadie gig shortly after, leaving Winkler behind.<br><br>A few years later, Jeff got injured after getting involved in a fight during a concert. He was told he could lose part of his eyesight, so his doctor asked him to stay in town in order to monitor him. It was a difficult time during which Jeff re-assessed his life choices.<br><br>He went back to school\u2014art school. His eyesight slowly returned, but he had to be careful. He took a few courses, experimenting with a wide range of mediums, ultimately choosing oil painting and digital art, the latter of which offered paid internships. He took up a desk job and found his calling in designing labels for microbreweries. He led a quiet, simple life: he brewed beer, took-in a rescue dog, designed tattoos, and freelanced album covers for bands he liked. All until one morning, when he got a phone call from Ormond saying that his father had passed, leaving a few things to sort out.<br><br>Jeff drove all the way back to Ormond. He felt a pang of nostalgia when he reached his late father\u2019s house. Inside, there was an old guitar case sitting in against the wall. It held a black, vintage model with a sticky note that said, \u201cfor my boy.\u201d<br><br>He stayed in town longer than he planned to, reminiscing about his childhood. Driving by his former high school, he remembered the mural he painted up Mount Ormond. He bought a 12-pack and headed to the lodge.<br><br>After weeks of not hearing back from Jeff, his colleagues assumed that grief had gotten the better of him. His neighbor got tired of sitting his dog, which became more and more agitated as days went by. The dog became a stray again, erring while seeking the familiar trail of Jeff\u2019s malty scent.",

		"story": "Jane Romero was the daughter of famous actress, Loretta Lawrence, of whom she had no memory. Her parents had separated when she was still a baby, mainly since her mother was often away filming. Jane was raised by her father, a struggling visual artist. She grew up torn between resenting her mother\u2019s absence from her life and admiring her presence on screen.<br><br>As a teenager, Jane secretly wished to emulate her mother\u2019s talent. She would direct and perform in plays, audition for TV commercials and help her father at his studio. During her senior year, she entered a national oratory contest and won first prize. Her performance attracted the attention of a radio-station that contacted her for an interview. During the live show, her natural charm and repartee impressed the staff, who offered her a part-time job at the station.<br><br>After graduating college in Communication, she quit her job at the station to work for a trendy variety show. But her frank delivery and ad-libs were not appreciated by the show\u2019s executives, who fired her after five months. Desperate for another opportunity, Jane pitched a show at the radio-station she used to work at, only to be turned down, her proposal being <i>too risky</i>.<br><br>Four months later, she received a phone call from a producer who had seen reruns of the show. He was looking for a co-host to spark up the failing show, <i>Quick Talk</i>.<br><br>Live television meant long hours, a low salary, and no stability, but it also offered a platform to broadcast her views. She disputed the crude inflammatory tone of <i>Quick Talk</i> and pushed for a relatable coverage of personal issues. Her honest delivery resonated with her audience and within weeks, the show\u2019s viewership was steadily growing.<br><br>After two years, she launched a full-hour segment called <i>The Jane Romero Show</i>, which was broadcast nationally and covered tabooed topics, including her personal struggle with abandonment. Her show broke records and her initials J.R. became synonymous with products ranging from beauty creams to fashion accessories.<br><br>But Jane needed more; she wanted others to follow in her footsteps. She published a memoir that covered her childhood with an absent mother. Her book was an instant best seller but was reviewed harshly. Critics called it <i>a serving of sad anecdotes seasoned with bland, generic self-help tips</i>. Jane took this criticism to heart, since despite her success, a voice in the back of her mind was starting to doubt her achievements.<br><br>Her success also generated an increasingly demanding schedule and a growing pressure to entertain constantly. During a particularly tense week, she canned an episode and instead launched a two-hour-long special on divorce. Her stress peaked when she learned that her mother had agreed to star in her show.<br><br>Jane put on a brave face and began the show. Most of it went without a hitch, but when her mother walked on set, smiling warmly at the audience, Jane\u2019s stomach lurched unpleasantly. She was consumed by a violent envy that had been festering. Yet she carried on with a strained smile, until Loretta interrupted her, saying that they were not actually related. The interview went haywire after that.<br><br>After the show, Jane was driving to her father\u2019s house in New Jersey. She needed to talk things over with him; she had not been feeling like herself lately. She turned on a freeway along the coast to avoid major congestion and popped some pain killers to numb the throbbing pain in her temples, which had been nagging her all day. Then she started to relax and turned on the radio; classical music was playing. The drive was slow. Black ice covered the highway, which was packed with cars on their way back home. Night fell. A darkness began to blur the corners of her vision and turned the headlights into swirls of red. Jane blinked to sharpen their outlines, but each time she closed her eyes, her eyelids became heavier and slower, until they remained shut, for a moment too long.<br><br>The following morning, authorities were fishing out Jane\u2019s car from the water. Despite leading a meticulous search for weeks, they were unable to retrieve her body.<br><br>The airing and production of <i>The Jane Romero Show</i> was suspended until after her funeral, which her father and mother attended.<br><br>As the public grieved for Jane, there was a surge of orders for J.R. products and all her episodes were re-released a month later, with an opening credit that wished her eternal peace.",

		"story": "During a weekend at a cabin with friends, Ashley J. Williams uncovered the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis (the Book of the Dead) and awoke something dark in the woods. Evil possessed his friends, whom he was forced to kill, and his right hand, which he sawed off. For the next thirty years, Ash ran from his past, working at a Value Stop department store and seducing women in dive bars. But he screwed up one night while being high, when he read from the Necronomicon to impress a woman. Evil found him once more, wrecking the life of those around him. But his coworkers, Pablo who was raised by a shaman and Kelly who was orphaned by the Deadites, helped him put up a fight. While battling Evil, Ash was reunited with his long-lost daughter Brandy, who encouraged him to embrace his role as savior of humanity. After a terrible fight with a fully formed demon, Ash, drawing his last breath, was taken by the Knights of Sumeria and transported into the future.<br><br>Ash awakened to a voice, his head throbbing. Since defeating a gang of Deadites a week ago, he had been in a perpetual state of hangover. He heard the voice once more; a woman singing, sensual and inviting.<br><br>Stepping into the corridor in his boxers, he strode toward the voice, which lead to the public locker room. As Ash pushed open the door, the singing stopped. There was a rustling of curtains. He called out, entering the change room. His voice reverberated on the moldy tiled walls. He pressed on, reaching a shower that was still dripping wet. Cold, humid fingers ran down his bare back. He turned around.<br><br>A woman stood naked, her skin glistening in the morning light that streamed in from high windows. Ash recognized her instantly: Linda Emery, one of his former high school flings. They had gotten back together thirty years later, while saving their hometown from Evil. He had ended their relationship soon afterward, preferring to indulge freely in his new-found popularity.<br><br>Linda winked at Ash, who closed the distance between them. He caressed her cheek wistfully: <i>What was she doing here? Did she know anything about the whereabouts of his daughter? And Pablo and Kelly?</i><br><br>A sharp blade dug into his hand, making him jump back. Linda slid a finger across the edge of her blade, collecting Ash\u2019s blood on her fingertip. She smiled, and her skin shriveled, her hair faded, her shoulders stooped, and her curves sagged, aging decades older in a matter of seconds. She attacked Ash, who poorly managed to block, being half-naked.<br><br>Every blow she delivered earned him a new wound. She slashed his bad knee and he fell to the floor. As she jumped on top of him, Ash shrieked in disgust, knocking the knife out of her grasp. Her varicose hands wrapped around his neck, strangling him. Gasping, he outstretched his arm, hand landing on a soap dispenser. He spurted out some liquid on his fingers and poked her in the eyes. The elderly woman winced, weakening her hold, and Ash elbowed her in the face, knocking her back. He rolled over and grabbed the knife on the floor. Just as he was about to plant it in her chest, he stopped. There was something else he wanted more.<br><br>He pressed the blade against her throat. <i>Let\u2019s make a deal, demon. In exchange for not killing you, you portal me back to my friends.</i> The demon agreed.<br><br>She began reciting the incantation, instructing Ash to repeat after her, which he failed to manage. When nothing happened, Ash threatened the demon, who argued back, blaming his poor pronunciation. Their combined exchange of Sumerian words triggered a hiss from the showers behind them. The wet tiled floor darkened, and the pipes burst. A whirlpool of dirty water, shower curtains, and used toilet paper swallowed the demon, while Ash held onto a locker door, which slowly slipped from his fingers.<br><br><i>FFFUUUC\u2014</i><br><br>Ash landed flat on his chest in the realm of The Entity, sputtering grass. He got up, brushing off the dry clothes he suddenly had on. Then he looked around and his grin fell. It was the kind of place that made two things obvious: one, there wasn\u2019t any bar for miles, and two, he was going to need his shotgun and chainsaw, both of which he lacked. As he started to walk toward a glinting light ahead, a scream rippled through the trees.<br><br><i>Groovy.</i>",

She could only find\u00a0low grade clerical work or minor jobs as a hostess. With the last of the money her grandmother gave her, she purchased a racing bike and entered illegal street races where she won more money than she had ever seen. Rumors of her courage and quick reflexes spread like wildfire. Soon she had an unofficial retinue of women motorcyclists wearing\u00a0Yui\u2019s\u00a0signature pink. Along with a gang following her,\u00a0Yui\u00a0realized she had a stalker\u00a0following her\u00a0in the shadows.

		"story": "Growing up in a Lebanese household in Brooklyn, Zarina struggled with two unique cultural identities. She felt this cultural difference painted a target on her back. To avoid ridicule and bullies, she observed what popular kids liked and learned to project the image they preferred. At school, she would go by the name \"Karina,\" dye her hair lighter, and trash her \u201cforeign\u201d lunches.<br><br>At home, the news channel was always on. Urgent reports of injustice captivated Zarina, inspiring her to produce her own stories. When she was a teenager, she embraced her real name and roots and borrowed her father\u2019s digital camera to interview members of her community in Bay Ridge. By posting her content online, she slowly built a loyal following. Each week, she picked a new issue and challenged people to speak their mind on camera.<br><br>When she heard a rumor that a fast-food restaurant owner was exploiting workers, she decided to go undercover and produce a hard-hitting film. She modified her look, faked an accent, and secured a waitress position at the restaurant. After three weeks of unpaid work, she was fired for demanding her paycheck. To retaliate, she posted clips of the restaurant owner\u2019s abusive behavior and within hours the news had picked up her story, but somehow spun it to create sympathy for the restaurant owner.<br><br>Embittered by the experience, Zarina committed to become an independent producer and filmmaker. Her first feature film was for a competition at school inspired by an English class poem about Sacco and Vanzetti, two Italian migrants controversially executed for murder. Her film won first prize and launched her as an uncompromising documentary filmmaker.<br><br>Months later, her world turned upside down. A public video surveillance camera filmed her father carrying two coffees at a street corner a few blocks from home. A tall, hooded man stood behind him. The man shouted something at her father who took a step back, startled. Suddenly and unexpectedly, the man pushed him in the street as a car sped by.<br><br>His death sent a shockwave of anger and pain that left Zarina in pieces.<br><br>The perpetrator\u2014Clark Stevenson\u2014was soon arrested and incarcerated for manslaughter.<br><br>Zarina became obsessed with Clark--his gang \u201cIR-28\u201d, his short prison sentence, his apparent lack of remorse. A year went by and she had uncovered enough about Clark to shed more light on his crime. With the last of her inheritance she bought a new camera and a plane ticket to Nebraska and bribed the warden at Hellshire Penitentiary to let her interview Clark.<br><br>She filmed their first meeting and asked him about her father and his gang and his violent tendencies. Clark refused to talk; but, in the weeks that followed, she used her research to push his buttons and finally got a confession of a pre-meditated crime.<br><br>Zarina\u2019s film became a tribute to her father and the trail of blood left by gang violence. When the news finally picked up the story, it was because the film had gained international acclaim.<br><br>Some inmates contacted her when they heard about her documentary. Most of them shared eccentric anecdotes in hopes of being filmed, but one story stood out from the rest: an entire wing in Hellshire Penitentiary was sealed off because of the \u201cMad Mick Massacre.\u201d The official story was an Irish outlaw had heartlessly slaughtered the warden and his guards.<br><br>From working on her Sacco and Vanzetti film, Zarina knew that the \u2018official\u2019 story wasn\u2019t always the \u2018true\u2019 story. She investigated Hellshire\u2019s records and found an Irish-American inmate sentenced to twenty years for assault in 1860. According to the penitentiary\u2019s blueprint, the sealed off wing was part of Hellshire\u2019s original infrastructure. If she reached that sealed off section, she could shed some light on the Mad Mick story. All she needed was a way in.<br><br>Next morning, she was joining the Hellshire Penitentiary walking tour. She blended in the crowd of jet-lagged tourists and veered off when they headed toward the kitchen. She\u2019d memorized the blueprint and knew exactly where to go and how to avoid surveyance cameras. An unexpected security detail nearly cut her investigation short, but she was able to hide under an old, dusty prison bed. When the guards disappeared, she continued her search and finally found Mick\u2019s cell.<br><br>Entering the dark, dilapidated cell, Zarina ran her hand across the old brick wall. Her fingers felt a marking and traced the letters: DEATH TO BAYSHORE. A loose brick fell, revealing a gap.<br><br>She inserted her hand. Fingers landed on a piece of cold, cracked metal. She fished it out\u2026 an old, rusty wrench. A damp chill ran down her spine and she looked down; a man lay at her feet, bleeding, his limbs contorted and his eyes, dark and terrified\u2014her father\u2019s eyes. A pool of crimson blood on black pavement. Paralyzed, black fog filled the cell and she shut her eyes to push these nightmarish visions out of her mind.",

		"story": "Felix Richter was born to Janos and Ursula Richter in Coburg, Germany, where the Richter family had deep connections and were among the most respected of its physicians. His parents, both members of an ancient society, were always out of the Richter manor at medical conferences or providing humanitarian aid around the world. Travelling exposed young Felix to new cultures, languages, and architecture unlike anything he had ever seen before. He wasn\u2019t sure when the architectural bug bit, but when it did, it bit hard, and he knew that despite his family\u2019s legacy, he would one day design buildings that would inspire the world. By 23, he was considered an architectural prodigy having won the Swiss Architect Medal and the German National Design Award. Yet despite his success, Felix couldn\u2019t shake the gnawing feeling that his success had more to do with luck and connections than talent and hard work.<br><br>Growing up, Felix was socially awkward and introverted, preferring his imagination to the company of others. He had few friends so when he wasn't traveling with his parents, Felix was in his father\u2019s library devouring rare books, studying history and architecture, soaking up anything and everything he could on architectural movements throughout the centuries. His father hoped young Felix would learn to be more outgoing and hired every possible specialist to help improve his social skills. When these efforts failed, he threw in the proverbial towel and figured his son would learn when he was ready. He then joined young Felix in the library, where he helped him build elaborate wooden models of buildings while telling him wild stories about his secret club and their ancient battle against a dark and ominous force. Stories, Felix was sure, his father had made up to make his \u2018Imperiatti\u2019 group sound cooler than it actually was.<br><br>Felix sometimes wondered if his design sensibilities came from his summer trips to Dyer Island, a private island that boasted some of the world's finest homes and designs. Every summer, Felix would accompany his parents to the island, where members of The Imperiatti would encourage their children to network and forge lifelong connections. Felix didn\u2019t mingle well with the other teenagers, but he did make four friends who like himself didn\u2019t quite fit the \u2018high-society\u2019 mold. They were often ridiculed by other teens and disparagingly called \u2018The Pariahs,' a name they liked and gladly adopted. Instead of practicing public speaking and engaging in endless debates, The Pariahs spent most of their time exploring the ruins and mysteries of the island until one of their adventures took a turn for the worse.<br><br>Exploring an abandoned internment camp, they descended into what seemed to be an underground laboratory where they uncovered old, leather journals with illustrations and notes of inhumane experiments conducted on prisoners of the First Opium War held by the British East India Company. As they pushed through a locked door, they found a chamber scattered with human skeletons and dusty vials filled with an unknown serum. Before they could examine the contents, the ground seemed to shake beneath their feet and a hissing sound filled their ears. A strange fog suddenly appeared and giant claws seemed to burst from the ground as dark imagination mingled with reality to terrorize them. Before they understood what was happening, Felix\u2019s father and several other parents came to their rescue, using strange tools and objects to protect them. Felix stared at the scene in shock and disbelief. He wasn\u2019t sure if he was dreaming or living one of his father\u2019s ridiculous, supernatural stories. By the time he realized it wasn\u2019t a dream, it was all over. The Pariahs were safe, but their parents had mysteriously disappeared without a trace.<br><br>After the shock of his father\u2019s disappearance, Felix searched for any theory that could help him understand the phenomena he had encountered on the island. He exchanged notes with The Pariahs and other people he had met online who had also lost loved ones in a similar way. The tragedy had fostered a strong relationship between The Pariahs and for years they worked together to unravel the mystery of what had happened to their parents. But nothing made sense, and every lead they pursued hit a dead end. With time their efforts dwindled, and the five friends slowly grew apart, each going their separate ways, hoping to forget the nameless darkness that had robbed them of their parents.<br><br>Over the years, Felix proved to be an exceptional architect, though he found little inspiration working for others. He realized his father was right. His lack of social skills was holding him back. With dedication and purpose, he improved his diction and decorum and learned how to network or \u2018play-act\u2019 as he liked to call it. He created the perfect fa\u00e7ade to make himself more likable and popular with potential clients. After working for several architectural firms, he established his firm with his colleague Lauren Golder. Both shared a similar vision and were philosophically opposed to formulaic modernist buildings, often experimenting with unusual materials, shapes and structures.<br><br>Felix continued to undermine traditional expectations in favor of the edgy and unconventional devices that set the architectural world abuzz. But even with all the accolades, he couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that he was a phony, like an actor who had learned a part instead of a true architect who had inspired the world with an impeccable design. During these moments of insecurity and self-doubt, he would distract himself with endless parties and drown his anxieties in alcohol, wishing his father was still around for some harsh advice and tempered wisdom.<br><br>Eventually, Felix\u2019s girlfriend announced that he was going to be a father. The news shook him to the core and, wanting to inspire his unborn child as much as his father inspired him, he quickly pulled his life together. What he needed was a project that would challenge him and cement his worth as an architect. As fate would have it, the perfect opportunity presented itself when old friends of his father commissioned his firm \u2018Richter and Golder\u2019 to build something new and unconventional on Dyer Island. The challenge excited and terrified Felix, who now drowned his anxieties with articles and books on parenting.<br><br>Within six months, the Dyer Restoration Project was underway, and as Felix surveyed the island, he suddenly heard a familiar voice calling out to him from beyond the shattered Victorian buildings and the crumbling ruins hiding dark stories long hidden and forgotten. Through a strange, gathering fog, he saw a form slowly take shape. His eyes widened, and his lips parted, but no words issued forth. Could it be? Was it possible? No... it couldn\u2019t be... it was... impossible... and yet...<br><br>With dawning realization, Felix staggered back as he watched his father emerge from the fog. His legs felt weak, and his rising heartbeat thrashed in his ears. It was him. It was really him. His unborn child would know his grandfather, and he could finally show him how much he had accomplished since he disappeared. They stared at one another for a long moment. Then his father gave him a look of disappointment, turned his back on him, and proceeded to walk away. Over his pounding heart, Felix chased after him and was never seen again.",

		"story": "Born into a lush Parisian household, \u00c9lodie Rakoto grew up in a comfortable home miles away from the verdant island of Madagascar, her parents' birthplace. Her backpack was always heavy and usually contained no schoolwork. She carried the essentials: a few history books, some printed maps, and a compact shovel. Instead of wasting away with regurgitated facts from her classes, she explored the city to discover the stories behind each statue, neighborhood, and street sign. She collected bits and pieces of Paris, making it her own.<br><br>When she was fourteen, her parents took her to Dyer Island for a 'business trip.' To her grand disappointment, the island was a private site for exclusive members of the Imperiatti. She was forced to attend pretentious and awkward social mixers daily. After a few weeks on the island, she met the Pariahs, like-minded teenagers who had no interest in being pawns for their parents' political chessboard. On dull, rainy nights she would convince them to sneak out and explore the island unsupervised.<br><br>One foggy evening, they stumbled upon an abandoned internment camp. Felix, one of the Pariahs, didn\u2019t want to go in, but \u00c9lodie insisted. Inside, they found a strange underground laboratory in ruins. The Pariahs grew excited, browsing through the strange apparatuses for trophies and mementos. But \u00c9lodie noticed something in the far-left corner of the wall: odd scratches in the shape of a circle. She ran her fingernails against the cool concrete\u2014the marks were deep and narrow. A warm whisper suddenly sent her mind adrift\u2014<br><br>\u2014Deep, rumbling thunder. Black, glistening waves. An ashen sanded beach. Incomplete. She was compelled to touch the ice-cold sand and draw a circle with a line in the middle.<br><br>A sharp thunderclap and lightning whipped the sky. The ground shook as sleek, obsidian claws tore through the concrete floor, ripping the earth open. The building began to collapse and \u00c9lodie spotted her mother wielding a bizarre instrument while her father told her to run. Then--<br><br>Complete darkness.<br><br>\u00c9lodie never saw her parents again.<br><br>For years, this nightmare woke her in the middle of the night, cold, sweating, shaking like a leaf. As a child she suffered from night terrors and often resisted going to bed. To soothe her mind, her grandma would light a tea candle and tell her stories until the wick extinguished in a hot pool of liquified wax. The perfume of the warm vanilla-scented wax would lull \u00c9lodie to sleep as she envisioned stories of legendary heroes defeating fear and foes. \u00c9lodie had forgotten the stories, but she still remembered her longing for the verdant Malagasy rainforests and colossal mountains that her grandmother described. When \u00c9lodie felt cold and numb with grief, she would light a vanilla-scented candle and summon her childhood memories of this distant, idyllic place, raising her spirits to rise above her crippling depression.<br><br>Fourteen years later, \u00c9lodie still searched for the missing pieces of the puzzle. No rational explanation could explain her parents' disappearance, so she had been looking elsewhere. She researched any and all legends that mentioned a dark force that snatched people at night without a trace. From there, she translated old tales and built a tapestry of narratives from around the world that corroborated the uncanny way her parents had vanished on Dyer's island. She also gathered artifacts made by ancient civilizations who sought to destroy or resurrect the incomprehensible and indescribable Thing that took her parents. There were various names for it, differing from one language to the next: The Abyss, The Infinite, The Hole.<br><br>Her findings pushed her further into the dark field of occultism. The Pariahs were long gone. She'd alienated them with her theories. But she refused to give up on her parents.<br><br>\u00c9lodie set out into the cold, misty evening. She turned a corner, leaving Paris' 13th arrondissement, an eccentric neighborhood with a substantial library dating from the middle ages. She had pressing work to do for Hazra Shah, the Collector, an occult specialist who archived rare artifacts.<br><br>He\u2019d recruited her after she\u2019d salvaged a rare stolen Maori statue of spidery fangs like the claws she'd seen on Dyer's island. For the next five years, \u00c9lodie had been procuring occult relics for the Collector. In exchange, he provided large sums of money, equipment, and precise information about obscure manuscripts.<br><br>Just as the Collector requested, she had secured the annals of a witch trial convicting a mother birthing conjoined twins in the 17th century. According to legend, an occult incantation was engraved on a set of skulls, all of which the Collector possessed except one\u2014the witch's skull. There were no traces of where the skull was now, but \u00c9lodie had found a newspaper article dating back to the same year, mentioning that most remains had been relocated to the catacombs to avoid a pandemic. \u00c9lodie was acting on a hunch. Breaking into the catacombs to retrieve a lost skull involved certain risks, but no more than the previous work she'd done for the Collector.<br><br>With a flashlight, she followed the ancient layout of the catacombs and spotted a collapsed wall. A few large stones blocked the way in. She grabbed her portable XRF analyzer and scanned the materials of the wall. Working for the Collector had its perks. The brick mortar had been poorly mixed, showing high traces of sand. The whole thing was brittle, and the ground was moist from the damp evening air. This was her way in.<br><br>The journey beneath was long and treacherous. The air was heavy and moldy. She gasped when her key-chain flashlight hit an endless wall of bleached-white skulls.<br><br>Something cracked behind her. She spun around and collided headfirst with a baseball bat. Pain exploded in her skull and darkness filled her view.<br><br>When she came to, a man was carrying her over his shoulder, venturing deeper inside the catacombs. He was wearing a dark robe.<br><br>The Black Vale.<br><br>She'd managed to elude them until now. Ruthless and lethal, they went by many names. She'd figured out that they ultimately all worked for the same group, a ring of occult fanatics rumored to perform human sacrifices for what they called The Old One. She had to get out of here fast.<br><br>\u00c9lodie spotted a loose skull on the wall, grabbed it and smashed it on her assaulter's head. Stunned, the man lost his balance and \u00c9lodie hit the ground running. As she turned a corner, she suddenly felt a sharp pain to her side.<br><br>She looked down and saw a large blade planted there. Shocked, she removed the knife and warm blood spurted out.<br><br>Her heartbeat rang in her ears as her vision blurred.<br><br>She fell to her knees. Summoning all her strength, she drew a circle on the ground with a shaking, blood-red finger and traced a line in the middle.<br><br>An opaque heaviness fell over her shoulders. A familiar scent of vanilla-spiked fruits and lychee nuts coated the air. Thin, tropical rain drizzled down leafy vines. Warmth.<br><br>Madagascar.<br><br>A ghostly cry erupted from the thick foliage.<br><br>\u00c9lodie looked up and the vines turned into hissing snakes. The soft canopy soil suddenly turned ashen and collapsed under her feet. She sank into something dense and cold that swallowed her like quicksand. She screamed, before being smothered by... the abyss...the infinite... the hole...<br><br>She found what she had been searching for.",

		"story": "Resilient and ambitious, Yun-Jin was born into a life of hardship finding success in the music industry after years of effort and self-sacrifice.<br><br>As a child Yun-Jin was fascinated by sound, mimicking drums, and hitting keys on the piano. When she turned ten, however, she lost her instruments. Her family was heavily in debt and did not make the payments in time. The creditors took everything they owned, including the house. Yun-Jin held her four-year-old sister tightly as she cried. They moved into a windowless, two-bedroom basement. Since her parents worked day and night to pay their debt, Yun-Jin became her sister's caretaker. Every night she sang until they both fell asleep.<br><br>At seventeen, the renowned record label Mightee One Entertainment came to her high school to audition talent. She was rejected as an idol trainee but obtained an unpaid internship at the studio. For the following years, she created some of the studio's biggest hits, without any credit or recognition. To get her dues, she emerged in the public eye wearing flamboyant fashion and put soundbites into her songs that looped her artist name, Magnum Opus. Fans began to recognize her songs and she became the producer of NO SPIN, a poorly performing boy band who needed her special touch.<br><br>Dissatisfied with NO SPIN's commercial sound, she sought a rogue element to make the band stand out. Through her contacts in talent shows she found the edgy, raw sound of Ji-Woon Hak. She re-launched NO SPIN with Ji-Woon as its newest member. Within hours their first video was a viral sensation.<br><br>Their success cemented Yun-Jin\u2019s reputation as a shrewd producer. Adorned in high fashion to attend luxurious events, Yun-Jin's harsh, impoverished childhood seemed far behind her. She moved into a penthouse and dined with socialites in skyline restaurants with breathtaking views of Seoul.<br><br>The success of the first album broke records, setting the bar high for NO SPIN's second. As they were recording new tracks, the fire alarm suddenly blared. Concerned for her safety, Yun-Jin hurried to evacuate the building and left the dallying staff behind. Only when she bolted out into the street that she realized NO SPIN was nowhere amongst the coughing crowd. A goliath of flames engulfed the building, slowly tamed by the steady streams of fire hoses.<br><br>All members of NO SPIN perished in the fire except one: Ji-Woon. The album was ruined. The band was over. She would be shelved while Ji-Woon would rot away as an instructor for idol trainees. But she refused to be a victim who watched helplessly as vultures swooped in to take what was hers.<br><br>Unknown to Mightee One Entertainment, she created new tracks to re-launch Ji-Woon's career. She pushed him to tap into his grief and create a song exploring the pangs of sudden loss. The music video showed Ji-Woon saying goodbye to each member of NO SPIN. Yun-Jin cleverly launched the song under Ji-Woon's newly adopted stage name: The Trickster. He would embody both fear and awe like the legendary dokkaebi spirits.<br><br>Ji-Woon's song was a global phenomenon, its universal themes of grief and guilt resonating internationally. Together, Yun-Jin and The Trickster toured the world. Success greeted them on every shore. Yet disturbingly, so did a series of eccentric murders. This connection unsettled Yun-Jin as she noticed that the tour dates coincided with the victims' time of death. She was weary after the loss of NO SPIN and anxious to preserve her artist, so she increased the Trickster's security detail. What if the serial killer was an unhinged fan fixated on the Trickster, inspired by the artist's morbid songs?<br><br>Returning to Seoul, Yun-Jin worked with Ji-Woon on his new material. When she entered the studio at the brink of dawn, she was surprised to see Ji-Woon already there. He seemed exhausted, like he had worked all night. When she listened to his track, she discovered a bizarre intro filled with shrieks and snares. It was too experimental for her taste.<br><br>A week later, another death was reported. The body showed traces of torture and was arranged in the same flamboyant style as previous murders, this time diamond Cufflinks gouged into the victim's eyes. The following day, the victim was on every television channel. A video from the victim's social media showed her squealing, surprised when her boyfriend handed her a heart-shaped, birthday cake. Yun-Jin's stomach churned. That voice. So familiar. And yet, she had never met the victim.<br><br>The next morning, her heart froze when she listened to the Trickster's opening track. The shrieks in his song matched the victim's squeal. Did he sample the victim's birthday video? No, that was impossible: he had recorded this song before the murder was reported. She stared at Ji-Woon on the other side of the booth's glass window. He was NO SPIN's only survivor. Everyone else was dead. Not to mention the eccentric murders that matched his tour dates. Death trails that seemed to converge\u2026 to him.<br><br>If he caused\u2026 this, no artist would survive the scandal. Yun-Jin's career, no, her life would be over. All she had would be destroyed. A wave of nausea surged over her. Heart racing, she rushed to the restroom. Wild thoughts blazed through her mind as she splashed icy water over her face. There had to be a simpler explanation. Perhaps she was overworked. Or maybe, she did not trust her success. Her mind was fabricating this suspicion because disaster was easier to trust than success. It was all in her head. She returned to the recording booth, eager to put her worries behind her.<br><br>Months later, pressure came from Mightee One Entertainment executives. Revenue was down and they blamed the Trickster since they disapproved the violent themes in his music and the knife tricks he pulled during performances. While Yun-Jin was furious they scapegoated her artist, she agreed that Ji-Woon's sound was too niche to generate profit. She told Ji-Woon she fought them off but was ultimately outnumbered. Because of her initial fury, he believed her to be on his side. They were given three months to create and perform the next hit for Mightee One.<br><br>Months flew by and the time came for Yun-Jin to take a seat at the executives' private show. She was confident about her song but as soon as the music started, she knew something was amiss.<br><br>Dense, foul smoke permeated the room. Yun-Jin coughed and gasped for air. But the more she coughed, the more she inhaled. Her body sank in the chair, her limbs heavy and numb, and her eyes widened as she watched, terrified, a nightmare come to life.<br><br>The Trickster was a whirlwind of blood, slashing, stabbing, and chopping limbs. The executives were carved up like meat. They could not run. They were stuck, like Yun-Jin, paralyzed. A boiling rage swelled in her gut. How could she have denied her instincts? The fire. The murders on tour. It was him. It had always been him. And she had known from the start. Now her career was over, and so was Mightee One. Everyone she had worked with, her colleagues, her friends, dying before her eyes. Everything she had, taken from her once more.<br><br>No, she would not let him. He would pay. He would know her suffering. Suddenly, dark coils of black fog rose from the ground and she was... somewhere else.<br><br>Bright lights flashed and blinded her. A spotlight found her in the darkness. Then a crowd erupted, chanting her name. \"Magnum Opus! Magnum Opus!\"<br><br>She smiled and welcomed the darkness within.",

		"story": "Mikaela Reid was sixteen when her father passed away. She would always miss his sailing lessons at dawn, his colorful yet inedible tacos, and his warm, contagious laughter. She felt like she was paddling in a vast storm-black ocean, each rolling wave submerging her. Drifting in painful darkness, she almost lost herself, but resiliently, with love and care, she made her way back to shore.<br><br>Well-surrounded and supported by her friends, Mikaela put the past behind her and looked at life in a new light. She was excited to try new things and discovered storytelling as an outlet. Her friends liked her stories of daunting danger and hard-earned survival. She read horror stories more and more, savoring the powerful, heart-pounding escapism it provided. Autumn became her favorite season and she threw a grand production for Halloween every year, hosting all her friends for a thrilling night of horror stories, scary games, and homemade treats.<br><br>Over the years, she also showed interest in witchcraft and practiced light blessings, plant-based spells, and palm-reading divination. She gardened sage, mugwort, and lavender to craft homemade products such as body butters, soaps and skin lotions. She aspired one day to live off the products she made for friends and family.<br><br>In the meantime, she worked as a barista at the Moonstone, an independent and eccentric coffee shop in the artsy part of town. Every Friday night, she hosted an open mic at the coffee shop, performing stories live in front of customers. Julian, her best friend and roommate, recorded some of her shows and posted them online. Also, unbeknown to her, he submitted one of her performances to the Endless Halloween Festival where renown storytellers performed on stage for Halloween.<br><br>It was a beautiful surprise when Mikaela received an email from the festival inviting her to perform at their grand final on Halloween. The winning prize was big enough for her to launch her line of products. Excited, she burnt a stick of herbs in each room to dissipate negative energies, then began to craft her tale of horror.<br><br>Mikaela stayed up all night filling her notebooks with abandoned beginnings. She had a story in mind, but unearthing it took patience and skill. The following night, the nightmares began. For a week, she would wake in the middle of the night gasping for air. Her dream was the same every night. She was dragged down a cold set of stairs and thrown into a dark basement. Then her lungs would be set ablaze by a sharp iron hook stabbing her in the chest. A dark figure would pull on the hook and hoist her from the ground, slowly, until the pain waked her. The more she finessed her Halloween tale, the darker her nightmares grew.<br><br>As days passed, exhaustion, anxiety, and stress took a toll on her. Often distracted, her coffees at the Moonstone were rushed, acrid, or going to the wrong customer. She no longer blessed the coffee beans in the morning nor looked for omens in the leftover coffee grains. Her energy was low, and her magic felt drained.<br><br>When she woke up screaming one night, she had had enough. She asked Julian to watch her while she slept and record anything unusual. Julian agreed and started recording while Mikaela lay on her bed.<br><br>Minutes later, her fingers began to twitch, then her toes. Her breath became labored. Then Julian stared in shock as Mikaela slowly rose in the air, levitating over her bed. Panicked, he shook her shoulders to wake her, but stopped when she began to scream. He grabbed his phone to call an ambulance, but a powerful crash diverted his attention. He looked down the hallway and saw a large, spidery fang slam through the bathroom door.<br><br>Amidst the commotion, Mikaela awoke. She saw the black spidery fang shredding the bathroom door and jumped out of bed. She slammed her bedroom door shut and shouted at Julian to help her barricade the door. Before he could react, however, the power went out. The room was submerged in sudden darkness.<br><br>A second later, the lights came back on and an eerie quietness followed. Mikaela and Julian ventured out the bedroom carefully. The bathroom door looked intact and there was no sign of anything abnormal. But Julian had recorded every sound.<br><br>A sleepless night followed. When she returned to the apartment after her shift, Julian was not there. Mikaela wanted him to remove the recording of their ordeal, which he had posted online. Suspecting Julian might be at school, she left. The door clicked shut behind her, masking a stifled cry from the bathroom.<br><br>As she neared her car, she looked over her shoulder. Mikaela felt... watched. She whispered a protective spell and clutched her keys. Suddenly, a shadow pounced on the wall and she broke into a run. She reached her car and rushed inside, locking the doors. Breathing hard, she looked through the windows. No one was there. Perhaps it was her nerves playing tricks on her. She turned on the ignition and drove off.<br><br>The next day, Julian was still nowhere to be found. Mikaela had contacted everyone she knew. She looked for him all day and waited for him all night. Distraught and anxious, she missed her shift at the Moonstone. Halloween was tonight and so was the festival. Julian had entered the storytelling competition for her. He had supported her every time she doubted herself. Maybe he would be there. But between her nightmares and Julian's disappearance, she had been too worried to prepare a story for the contest. She looked at her notebook, filled with false starts. She could stay home, scared and sleepless. Or she could finish what Julian had started. There was a reason why she loved to tell horror stories. They made her feel brave enough to face any challenge.<br><br>That evening when the host called Mikaela's name at the Endless Halloween Festival, she boldly stepped on stage, dressed in costume: a black dress matched with a wide, witchy hat. She hoped to spot Julian in the crowd. But she could not find him and looking directly at the audience was a mistake. A sea of expectant faces was before her, eyes watching her every move. Her heart pounded in her chest as her hands began to shake.<br><br>She grabbed the warm microphone and cleared her throat. A thick silence greeted her, only interrupted by a distant cough. She reminded herself that tonight was All Hallows' Eve, when the veil thinned betwixt this realm and the one beyond. She had a story in her heart, a story that mattered. If she told it right, perhaps Julian would hear it.<br><br>Mikaela took a deep breath. The wet wind of Autumn whirled golden leaves around her. She inhaled the acrid smell of damp, foliage. She swallowed the bitter aftertaste of coffee still on her tongue. Distant crows cawed from an old oak tree. She closed her eyes. The crimson darkness under her eyelids turned darker. Her heartbeat slowed. She exhaled deeply, her breath a puff of mist in the cold night air. Now she felt awakened, refreshed for the first time in weeks, and ready to tell the tale of a lifetime.<br><br>She spoke into the microphone in a deep, haunting voice. She narrated a tale of billowing winds on a cold Autumn night. Of a loyal friend disappearing before daylight. Of forgotten victims hiding in the wings of darkness. Of throbbing graves, sealed with terrible secrets. And of eternal night in the shadow of death.<br><br>Mikaela pointed at the night sky and said that no darkness was truly beyond light. Even on this moonless night, the sky shined with long-dead stars.<br><br>A thick black fog engulfed Mikaela, to the audience's amazement.<br><br>And no one saw Mikaela Reid again.",

		"story": "Jonah Vasquez saw the truth behind the veil. His gifted mind understood numbers in a way few could. Sunsets, architecture, a blade of grass\u2014he saw more within them than eyes could gleam. He understood the language that explained them\u2014mathematics\u2014complex equations that continually played out around the universe to determine why and how we exist. Structures. Patterns. A law unbroken: physics.<br><br>His gift would have been overlooked had his family\u2019s history of poverty continued for another generation. But some patterns are meant to deviate from their common course, and Jonah\u2019s father strived to better his family with every muscle he had. What started as a job picking fruit near Fresno, California, eventually led to him owning a small mangrove. It wasn\u2019t much, but it was enough to provide Jonah a stable childhood and education.<br><br>Though placed in advanced classes, there were few signs of Jonah\u2019s brilliance to his peers. He was a normal boy with a few close friends, a passion for baseball, and an interest in ancient civilizations. However, when he was alone, his mind turned to numbers\u2014and these, to Jonah, were the most fascinating of marvels. He delved into Fibonacci and Recaman\u2019s sequences and was soon poring over complex equations from history's leading mathematicians.<br><br>On his 16th birthday, he received an unaddressed card. There was nothing within but the following numbers: <b>8, 25, 19, 44, 1; -20.37, -69.85; 13, 2, 26, 11, 1</b><br><br>It was a puzzle. Perhaps a gift from his math teacher or a relative who knew of his penchant for solving brainteasers. But somehow this was different. While he immediately recognized the GPS coordinates, quickly discovering they led to a location in Chile, the other numbers meant nothing to him. Every attempt he made led to failure.<br><br>Over time, he abandoned the puzzle, convinced it was flawed. He went on to university and, upon graduation, was hired as a codebreaker by the CIA. On his first day, written in his employee handbook, were the numbers from years ago: <b>8, 25, 19, 44, 1; -20.37, -69.85; 13, 2, 26, 11, 1</b>. A tension in the back of his neck materialized, a feeling that he was being toyed with. He returned to the puzzle, only to discover that his years of experience would reveal no new information. He couldn\u2019t dwell on it\u2014he had a job to do.<br><br>He was put to work deciphering messages from signal stations around Europe. Archived footage found that for twenty-three years dozens had been operating in an unknown capacity. Simple blinks of light hid complex codes that revealed disjointed information. It wasn\u2019t much to go on, but he discovered the messages seemed to involve powerful and wealthy individuals from around the globe.<br><br>The project was abruptly shut down. All agents involved were transferred to other assignments. Jonah was moved to a covert task force in the newly formed democracy of Kwantana, where he intercepted and decoded messages from bands of rebels. His work enabled the U.S. to target numerous rebel locations. Then the bombs dropped.<br><br>It was discovered too late that the messages were decoys. Civilian casualties were staggering, the true numbers covered up by officials. Jonah blamed himself. He saw firsthand the damage done and the families torn apart. He took a leave of absence but remained in Kwantana, surveying the damage. He had to do something. He cashed in his favors with one of the CIA\u2019s digital security experts and infiltrated the rebellion\u2019s computer network. From there, he took stock of the numbers, and made changes he thought no one would notice. Small amounts of money were siphoned from the rebels to those who lost their homes and loved ones.<br><br>It seemed like a smooth play, undetectable and bloodless\u2014until the day the gunshots rang through his suite. Jonah hit the floor as glass shattered and holes punched through his walls. Grabbing his laptop, he broke his kitchen window and leapt to the neighboring building\u2019s roof. Before he could even rub his throbbing ankles, the small house exploded into flames. He ran, not looking back. He climbed down to the alley, made his way to the slums, and concealed himself among rickety shanties of cardboard and rotting wood. A week later, he arrived at an American embassy, exhausted, dust-ridden, and defeated.<br><br>Before he could take a breath, he received a call from his chief officer at the CIA: \"Was it worth it? You over this crusade of yours?\"<br><br>He felt powerless. And so, he returned his focus to what was simple, what was black and white: numbers.<br><br>His chief officer gave him a new assignment, one classified to all but a few. His research on the signal stations had reached someone high up, and the project was re-opened under a veil of secrecy. Jonah dedicated his time to deciphering the codes, partly out of fascination and partly to forget the guilt that resided within him. What started with signal stations led him to something even more baffling: horror podcasts.<br><br>In the stories of campfire thrillers and slasher tales from around the world were carefully concealed codes. Sometimes numbers. Sometimes words. Each time, as if being a secret password or handshake, he found the following message: Sacrifice is rebirth. Hidden in the code was information on a network of powerful people, all working towards what, he didn\u2019t know. There was chatter of summonings and rebirths, sacrifices and hunts. Jonah assumed much of it was red herrings attempting to mislead. Up late that night, he analyzed another code\u2014this time concealed in a story of vampires. What he deciphered sent a chill through his spine.<b>8, 25, 19, 44, 1; -20.37, -69.85; 13, 2, 26, 11, 1</b><br><br>The numbers had returned. They haunted him. He saw them when he closed his eyes. They clung to his sleepless mind, begging for attention. He checked the coordinates as he had years ago\u2014it was nothing but a Chilean graveyard. He logged into the CIA database and searched the history of the location. Only one hit came up: a cold case where bodies were found in the area, the corpses eaten by hundreds of crows.<br><br>Jonah couldn\u2019t let the mystery go on any longer. The numbers had followed him all his life and he was ready to follow them. Knowing his chief officer wouldn\u2019t approve, he booked a ticket to Chile without anyone\u2019s knowledge. It was time to see what was so special about the coordinates. Less than 24 hours later he arrived at \u201320.36, -69.85. He found himself under the sweltering sun, standing in the graveyard of a ghost town.<br><br>There was nothing but dust and bones. Jonah spit into the dirt and puzzled over the numbers once more. He slumped next to an old grave, under the eyes of a watchful crow. He missed home, he missed the mangrove, he missed a time before the complexities of the universe crashed down on him. He looked out at the old derelict buildings on one side and the sweeping desert on the other. There were similarities to Fresno\u2014the dry heat, the sunset that cast an orange glow on the dusty ground. But it wasn\u2019t home. Not to him. He looked at it from the eyes of a man who didn\u2019t belong in this place.<br><br>And then Jonah understood.<br><br>He was analyzing the code from his own experiences, his own view of the world. There was so much he overlooked. With feverish devotion, he considered what the numbers could signify for other cultures: ancient Egyptian measurements, Persian currencies, and... antiquated calendars. He finally understood.<br><br>He sifted through his knowledge of ancient civilizations before coming to the Tanyrian calendar. Plugging in the numbers as dates, he converted the first half of them over to the Gregorian calendar. He wasn\u2019t prepared for the number it would reveal: his birthday. The world spiraled around him. With sweaty palms, he calculated the remaining numbers. It gave him another date: today.<br><br>The code... it was about Jonah, at this location, at this moment. His hands shook. His heart pounded against his ribs. Was he part of a prophecy or had someone led him down this path? He didn't know. For once, numbers no longer made sense.<br><br>A heavy fatigue came over him and the world shifted in impossible ways. He knew the equations behind nature, he knew what he saw couldn\u2019t be. He witnessed his father\u2019s mangrove beyond the desert and felt overwhelming comfort. Crows cawed in the distance and the smell of citrus wafted on the breeze. He considered that he was once more a child, and the numbers nothing but a horrible dream. Trapped in nostalgic thoughts, he didn't notice the dark fog seeping from the grass, swirling its way towards him. Crows flew from the branches, screeching relentlessly, flying in a circle above. It was too late when he realized the scent on the breeze was no longer citrus.<br><br>It was blood.",

		"story": "As a child, Yoichi gained an interest in the supernatural from his father and mother when an inexplicable curse claimed both their lives. As an adult, Yoichi graduated with top honours in marine biology from a university in Tokyo, and, following in his father\u2019s footsteps, became the youngest professor in the school\u2019s history. But his career began to unravel when two of his students disappeared while doing research in Izu Oshima. The mere mention of Izu Oshima triggered painful memories from his past. Deep, hidden memories bubbled up from the murky, black depths of his subconscious. Blurred faces on images, twisted mouths, inexplicable deaths suddenly filled his mind. The shouts of people calling him a monster. And then\u2026 the monster\u2026 Sadako rose from the abyss to let him know the curse was not over. It would never be over.<br><br>With a cry, Yoichi shut his eyes and slowly released his fear. When he opened his eyes again, Sadako was gone, but something had returned. Something ominous and otherworldly. He could feel an unnerving presence near him, breathing deeply like the heaving sea. Was Sadako tormenting him? Was a spirit trying to warn him? Or was it something else? Something that consumed people. Something that made people disappear. Yoichi wasn\u2019t sure. He had spent his life trying to understand his psychic abilities and the supernatural. His instincts told him the answers somehow lay with water. He had, after all, dedicated his life to studying intelligent life and unexplored realms within the ocean. Perhaps he needed to readjust his definition of intelligent. Or his definition of life.<br><br>Thirsting for truth, Yoichi entered a frenzy of research into the fringes of parapsychology, cryptozoology, theology, folk history. The more he expanded his field of expertise, the more he was ridiculed and ostracized. Once viewed as a brilliant young mind, Yoichi was now considered an eccentric and a liability. In mere months, the university terminated his position. Undeterred, Yoichi sought professorships at other schools, but no reputable college in Japan would take him. As a last resort he approached media outlets, and by some twist of fate, the company where his mother had worked at as a journalist offered to fund his research in exchange for articles and first publishing rights to his story.<br><br>During this difficult time, Yoichi\u2019s father returned to him\u2014his spirit silently goading him to continue the course he had chosen. And so, working around the clock in his tiny Tokyo apartment, he allied himself with other researchers in the paranormal field. Within months, he came across a story that mirrored the disappearances of his students: four vloggers had mysteriously disappeared near a lighthouse in Scotland. With a great sense of urgency, Yoichi took the first flight he could to Glasgow. A professor at a local university had come to many of the same conclusions as he had nearly seventy years earlier when a film crew disappeared near the very same lighthouse. There was some kind of intelligence in the water\u2014some kind of darkness calling from the sea like an ancient siren. As Yoichi examined the research, his father suddenly appeared to let him know he was on the right path.<br><br>Guided by his father, Yoichi chartered a fishing boat and headed toward a small cluster of islands known as the Seven Hunters. Darkness fell as they approached the isles. The lighthouse, now automated and controlled remotely, sputtered and winked out of existence like a dying star. The ocean began to stir violently, lightning flashed, and the fisherman begged Yoichi to turn back, but Yoichi refused. He was too close and would not be deterred. As they argued the ocean raged and tossed the ship high and low. Then one giant wave lifted the boat as high as a house and dashed it to pieces against dark, jagged rocks.<br><br>Yoichi didn\u2019t remember much after that. He remembered falling into the water. He remembered swimming to the landing where he saw his father standing on the gallery of the lighthouse beckoning him. He remembered staggering through thick black fog as he climbed the stairs. He remembered the water level rising with every step until the frothing mouth of the raging ocean swallowed him whole.",

		"story": "Haddie spent her youth in a household brimming with love. Her mother, Professor Basant Kaur, moved across the world to teach agricultural science at a university in Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Quebec. Her father, Rajan Singh, found remarkable success with a catering business in the small, Quebecoise town. Her house constantly swirled with the wonderful aromas of cumin, chillies, masala, cardamon and fresh, steaming naan pulled from a tandoor oven. Her earliest memories were filled with stories of India and on her tenth birthday her parents promised to visit Punjab just after the new year.<br><br>During the holiday season, her parents went to a party with their closest friends, Marise and Francois Rois. When Haddie called her parents to say she felt sick, they left in a hurry. Driving through the winding, snow-swept roads of rural Quebec, Rajan lost control of the car, skidding into an icy, gnarled forest. It would be two days before their bodies were found trapped in the vehicle. As Haddie\u2019s fever broke, the police arrived at her doorstep telling her that they had not suffered. But Haddie was old enough know to the police were just being kind. The next morning, she woke up with white hair and a question that would haunt her for the rest of her life.<br><br>The Rois took Haddie in, doing their best to fill the hole left by her parents. Despite the enormous loss, Haddie was again surrounded with love: the love her adoptive parents had for their son, Jordan, and the love the three had for her. But the trauma of losing her parents seemed to unlock something within her. She began to see things nobody else could see; horrible, unnatural, unexplainable things. Apparitions tormented her in class, at home, in bed. Her unexpected screams earned her the nickname \u201cHelly Haddie,\u201d only adding to her alienation and anguish. Once a cheerful and social child, Haddie walled herself off to the world.<br><br>With time Haddie realized her uncanny abilities only triggered in certain areas\u2014dark areas. It was as though there were places in the world where another dimension somehow bled into our own. Jordan called these intersecting areas Overlaps, and they seemed to give Haddie insight into a dark, shadowy world straight out of a cosmic horror story. When Haddie graduated from high school, she felt an unexplainable tug to discover who her parents were. To raise money for a trip to India, her brother Jordan suggested that they use her abilities to explore and document all the haunted places in Quebec, starting with a haunted asylum. At the Dorea Institute, Haddie could see and hear residual memories... patients, doctors, and so much more.<br><br>While recording her impressions at the institute, she offhandedly called the encroaching dimension the Ravage since it not only assaulted her with memories from all times and places but also gave the sense of feeding off psychic energy. The Ravage, she sensed, was a living mosaic of human suffering that was slowly corrupting and devouring the world. She concluded that they needed to investigate more to see if there was anything to her hypothesis.<br><br>Jordan presented the footage and recordings to their uncle Stefan who helped them turn what they had documented into a web series. Within days of uploading the first episode, Ravages of the Abyss was a viral hit. True crime fans, ghost-chasers, and skeptics flooded the comments with their own theories of what she was experiencing. Stefan handled the production, and before long, he presented Haddie with her first cheque as a professional podcaster.<br><br>Now with a working budget, Haddie was able to investigate the most haunted places in the world seeking answers about the Ravage. Her investigations led her to a secluded island where once an entire town had mysteriously disappeared leaving dozens of empty homes. She never felt such a strong influence of the Ravage as she did here. It pulsed with suffering and cruelty and repressed darkness.<br><br>Haddie absorbed the emotions of the ghost town and closed her eyes. Calming herself and silencing her mind, she began to hear guttural screams and cries and whimpers. When she opened her eyes again, she could see the scintillating orange residual memories of people tearing each other apart in the mud and rain. Then everything disappeared as a much older version of her stepbrother beckoned her from one of the homes. She chased after him only to stop suddenly with the realization that the Ravage was toying with her emotions, playing tricks on her, making her see things that couldn\u2019t possibly be real.<br><br>The encounter nearly put Haddie off the project entirely, but she was now the linchpin for a company that fed her family. Her uncle Stefan continued to line up sites to visit, and after a personal trip backpacking across India, Haddie carried on subjecting herself to the horrors of the Ravage.<br><br>Then, while investigating a haunted World War II bunker in the Alps, Haddie heard someone faintly crying out for help in Punjabi. Snow flurried in the bunker as a tunnel suddenly opened to a snow-covered forest. A horn blared in the distance and faded away. She saw the glow of red lights through a wall of snow and felt her heart skip a beat as she rushed to a crumpled, blue car pinned between two massive pine trees. Through the shattered windshield she saw the bodies of her parents stuck in pools of frozen blood.<br><br>Haddie narrowed her gaze and saw tiny plumes of vapor floating from their trembling blue lips. With a profound sense of urgency, she rushed around the wreck trying her best to push, pull, and kick her way in. All to no avail. As she cried out to them that she was sorry for being sick, that the accident was all her fault, their eyes snapped open and, in unison, they answered the question that had anchored her life to their death.<br><br><i>Yes... Beti... we suffered...</i><br><br>With a terrible cry Haddie fell back into the snow as ice tendrils wrapped around her and pulled her down into a world of endless darkness.",

		"story": "Born to Alberto and Caterina Toscano in 1343, Vittorio Toscano was the youngest of three and third in line to inherit his family\u2019s land. At age fifteen, his father sent him to train with Ettore Fabrizio, the same knight who trained his older brothers in the military arts. But Vittorio didn\u2019t take to combat training the way his brothers did. As a student of philosophy, he believed physical violence to be the last refuge of the incompetent.<br><br>Infuriated by Vittorio\u2019s pacifism, Fabrizio ordered one of his pages to attack him. Vittorio dodged and blocked the blows, but refused to fight back. When his enraged opponent lunged, Vittorio parried. His attacker tripped, falling on his own dagger. He bled out in less than a minute and Vittorio threw down his sword, swearing never to pick it up again.<br><br>Since Vittorio demonstrated an aptitude for scholarship, his frustrated father sent him to study with his Uncle Renzo. Besides being the Duke of Portoscuro, Renzo was also a scholar and collector of rare artifacts.<br><br>Under Renzo\u2019s tutelage, Vittorio focused his studies on lost civilizations and ancient history. He researched forgotten tomes and became an expert on the philosophy and wisdom of ancient secret societies and obscure guardians of knowledge. Guardians present in almost every century and culture. Guardians that went by manifold names depending on the time and region and were said to be from another dimension\u2014a perfect world. He collected anything on Watchers, Keepers, Guides, Masters, Observers.<br><br>Vittorio\u2019s research revealed these guardians acted as gatekeepers of advanced and arcane knowledge that would gradually help humanity transcend to a higher plane of existence. He theorized the Observers waited for humanity to acquire wisdom before releasing knowledge that otherwise would lead to their self-destruction. Slowly, these Observers found ways to inspire humanity with knowledge that would stimulate growth, understanding and collective wisdom.<br><br>Vittorio adopted his Uncle Renzo\u2019s view that greed for money and power was the source of all conflict. His hope was that the lost knowledge of these gatekeepers might bring peace, harmony, and order to a violent world.<br><br>At Vittorio\u2019s urging, Renzo mounted an expedition to find lost relics and artifacts from the ruins of antiquity. In Hungary, they discovered a bronze dodecahedron that dated back to Roman times. In Asia minor, they uncovered a hidden tunnel beneath the Obelisk of Theodosius where they discovered stone tablets engraved in Akkadian cuneiform.<br><br>They told the tale of a mysterious artifact split into three and scattered across the world.<br><br>A clue led them to the ruins of Troy where a secret chamber revealed a treasure trove of antiquities. The most precious was a piece of that mysterious artifact. Another clue led them to Isle of Rhodes where a hidden cave held a second part of that same relic. In Delphi, under the Temple of Apollo, Vittorio discovered the third piece on a black marble altar. Engravings on the altar showed a map of Crete and a star over the Palace of Minos.<br><br>Deep in the labyrinth below the ruins of the palace, Vittorio discovered a place to put the key created by the three relics. Ancient machinery came to life. A stone wall slid open, revealing a hidden vault.<br><br>Renzo and Vittorio entered and found a white marble wall inscribed with what seemed to be a form of Sanskrit. The message warned of a cult that sought to corrupt humanity with knowledge it wasn\u2019t ready for. They had hunted down the Observers and imprisoned them. But before being imprisoned, the Observers had hidden artifacts around the world with secret knowledge about this dark force and how to stop it from destroying the world.<br><br>The message on the wall also spoke of a stone from an ancient school that held the secrets of traveling between planes of existence. Vittorio, believing the stone held the key to finding the Observers or their perfect world, called the stone \u2018Lapis Paradisus.\u2019<br><br>As they exited the vault, Renzo stepped on a black serpent. The serpent sank its fangs into Renzo\u2019s leg and disappeared as quickly as it appeared. The venom spread fast and within minutes he passed away. As Renzo\u2019s only heir, Vittorio inherited his estate, his library, his title, and his vast fortune. Determined to honor his uncle and help humanity transcend its weakness, greed, and cruelty, he knew he had to find the Lapis Paradisus and free the Observers if they were still alive.<br><br>In 1391, Vittorio mounted an expedition. He employed a mercenary knight to aid in the effort and offer protection. Formerly a member of the Guardia Compagnia, Tarhos Kov\u00e1cs feared no man or beast. Vittorio\u2019s explorations and discoveries eventually led them to the heavily guarded catacombs beneath the Portuguese city of Sintra. If the expedition wanted to enter, they would have to kill those who guarded it. Vittorio had no wish to shed blood and told Tarhos to find another way.<br><br>Tarhos defied Vittorio and by the end of the day had him in irons.<br><br>When they returned to Italy, Tarhos locked Vittorio in a dungeon and began a campaign of torture in Portoscuro, promising to stop when he revealed the meaning behind the stone.<br><br>Within weeks, Tarhos grew tired of torturing the townsfolk, and Vittorio was left to rot in the dungeon with no one to talk to but the rats. In his solitude he scratched the symbols from the Lapis Paradisus into the stone floor. He attempted countless sequences while imagining a world like paradise. And just when he was about to surrender to hunger and despair, he tried one last sequence while meditating on a world of endless peace and compassion.<br><br>At first, he thought he had failed. He gasped with the last of his strength as the rats approached menacingly, preparing to feast on his defeated, sallow flesh. Then, suddenly, a cold, unnatural, black fog rose from the stone floor and within moments he heard cries of anguish and crows circling above him. With difficulty he clambered to his feet and found himself in another world\u2014<br><br>Not the paradise he had expected.",

		"story": "If you were to ask, Thalita Lyra would tell you that what she wanted in life more than anything was to bring people together. Whether it was her father selling out clubs for the latest forro band he\u2019d signed, or her mother showing off Botafogo, Lapa, and Ipanema to groups of tourists from around the world, Thalita loved seeing people come together to share their passion and form meaningful connections.<br><br><br><br>As a teenager, Thalita found her community through kite-fighting. Her uncle Inacio taught Thalita and her younger brother, Renato, to settle their petty squabbles through making kites and flying them into each other until someone\u2019s string is cut and a winner is decided. Thalita and Renato would spend their summers at Inacio\u2019s beachfront kite shop, working in the mornings, and fighting kites in the afternoon. Their antics caught the attention of kids and adults alike, and it wasn\u2019t long before Thalita started teaching kite-fighting at the shop. Eager to connect with even more people, Thalita would film these fights and post them online. Free publicity, she told her uncle.<br><br><br><br>Little did Thalita know that her kite-fighting videos would be her ticket to stardom. Videos that featured her and her commentary would get more hits, with viewers commenting on Thalita\u2019s kite-fighting insights and her charm. The videos even caught the eye of a modelling agent. Before she knew it, Thalita was booking photoshoots for print ads and appearing in commercials. She loved the work and knew it wouldn\u2019t be long before she could transition to acting. Then she would be capital-F Famous, like the stars of the telenovelas she watched growing up. Her community would span all of Brazil, and maybe even beyond.<br><br><br><br>But it was not to be.<br><br><br><br>Little by little, modeling took Thalita further from the kite shop. First, she had to give up playing, to let the nicks on her hands heal. Then, she had to spend her days networking, schmoozing, and lining up gigs well in advance. By the time Thalita graduated high school, her agent was eager to get her even more work. Which meant even less time at the kite shop. All this hard work and dedication will be worth it, she told herself.<br><br><br><br>Years passed in a flurry. Thalita was burned out and sick of the awkward stares and lingering glances from strangers. Fame, it seemed, was not as glamourous as she thought it would be. Late nights talking with Renato helped her realize what it was she was missing: connection. Genuine connection with like-minded people. That is how her father and mother drew people to them. And kite-fighting was what connected Thalita with others.<br><br><br><br>Within a few short months, Thalita had quit modelling, used her money to open her own shop \u2013 with Inacio\u2019s blessing, of course \u2013 and brought Renato on as her business partner. Fun Kites Rio became the premiere destination for kite-fighting materials, and Thalita\u2019s fame helped attract even more people to the hobby.<br><br><br><br>It was a great start, but Thalita, as always, wanted to reach even more people.<br><br><br><br>Fun Kites Rio\u2019s first tournament was a success, drawing hundreds of participants to the outskirts of Rio to watch dozens upon dozens of kites danced in the sky. In between socializing with old and new friends, helping at the concession stands, and even playing a match or two, Thalita found a few moments to cry happy tears by herself.<br><br><br><br>She had done it. This was exactly the community she wanted to create.<br><br><br><br>By the time the sun set and the tournament came to a close, the field was covered in litter. Thalita and Renato stayed behind to clean up. The full moon was high in the sky when Renato noticed something: a strange drone floating over the field.<br><br><br><br>Thalita\u2019s mischievous childhood self came roaring back. Time for a challenge: a race to take down the drone. Renato couldn\u2019t help but accept.<br><br><br><br>In the end, Thalita\u2019s kite was the one to get caught in the drone\u2019s rotor blades. She cheered as Renato watched the thing sputter into the forest, leaving a trail of smoke in its wake.<br><br><br><br>Thalita didn\u2019t want to look for the fallen drone. She was happy to leave her kite behind. But Renato walked off to the trees on his own, and Thalita couldn\u2019t let her brother wander the dark forest by himself.<br><br><br><br>Deep in the woods, Renato found more than just the drone. Thalita heard a scream and watched as a man drenched in blood emerged from the forest. He grabbed her brother, desperate for help, but it was already too late. Thalita nearly screamed as the man split in two and a woman stepped forward, covered in high-tech hunting gear.<br><br><br><br>Why wasn\u2019t Renato moving?<br><br><br><br>She grabbed her brother and ran. Another drone floated overhead, like the one she had downed with her kite. They were the hunter\u2019s eyes, and she had plucked one of them from the sky.<br><br><br><br>Renato was in shock, and Thalita saw that his arm had been cut deeply. When? It didn\u2019t matter. He was bleeding, and they needed to get to safety. That was when she saw the factory. A rotting brick building, collapsing under the weight of time.<br><br><br><br>Thalita led Renato into the factory and found a dark alcove to hide. The hunter followed, and she dragged some wooden beams across the entrance. The only way out, blocked off. Thalita knew time was running out. If the hunter didn\u2019t find them first, her drone would.<br><br><br><br>Thalita peeked from their alcove. The factory was changing, its dark and dingy walls dissolving to a bright and sunny landscape.<br><br><br><br>A beach.<br><br><br><br>She found her resolve. A way out. A chance to survive. All she had to do was run.<br><br><br><br>Thalita put her arm around Renato and pulled him to his feet. She thought she heard Renato telling her to stop, but she ignored him. This was their chance. They ran along the beach, leaving the hunter behind, kicking up warm sand with each stride.<br><br><br><br>Thalita never stopped running, not even when the sand turned into swirling black fog.",

		"story": "Growing up, Renato acted less like a child and more like a scientist, studying the world and people around him. He would poke classmates in the face or stand too close to them, curious to see their reaction.<br><br><br><br>It was no surprise that young Renato had a hard time making friends. He was often the target of bullies, especially when he started advancing through school. Sitting in classes with kids a year or two older than him \u2013 and still outperforming them \u2013 did not ingratiate Renato with his peers.<br><br><br><br>Renato enjoyed two things: solving puzzles and annoying his older sister, Thalita. It was his way of showing his love. Renato saw how easily Thalita won over kids and adults alike and wanted to be like her. So, when Thalita started to take an interest in flying kites, Renato did too.<br><br><br><br>His parents knew Renato needed help socializing. When he turned thirteen, they volunteered Renato to work at Uncle Inacio\u2019s kite shop on the beach during the summer. Thalita was making new friends there, maybe he would too. Instead, Thalita spent the day telling Renato what to do, which annoyed him more than anything. The bickering got so bad that Uncle Inacio had to teach them the art of kite-fighting to settle their differences.<br><br><br><br>Renato loved it immediately.<br><br><br><br>He enjoyed kite-fighting so much, he didn\u2019t even mind when he lost. As Inacio expected, they started to fight less and play more.<br><br><br><br>If only Renato had such luck with other people. Thalita would tell him to stop being so competitive with the kids they were teaching to kite-fight, but Renato wouldn\u2019t listen. He hated it when anyone told him what to do. When Thalita started spending less time at the shop to focus on her modeling, Renato had to step up as teacher. More than anything, he would hear how much everyone missed his sister.<br><br><br><br>Renato graduated from high school two years early, and his parents suggested he take some time to do charitable work. University, or an early career, could wait. Renato just wanted to be left alone and treated like an adult. Thalita suggested that Renato find a place to play guitar \u2013 if he could practice his guitar-playing and put himself out there, Thalita promised the family would finally stop telling him what to do all the time.<br><br><br><br>That was music to his ears.<br><br><br><br>Renato decided to volunteer at a local retirement home. First, he played guitar for the residents, then he started helping out in the kitchen, and before he knew it, Renato was learning what it meant to truly care about other people. To make the effort to help others without getting anything in return. For the first time, Renato felt like he had the power to make other people\u2019s lives better.<br><br><br><br>This new insight came in handy when Thalita was at a crossroads of her own. She wanted to pursue modelling and acting, but she missed the kite shop more than anything else. Renato didn\u2019t do more than listen when Thalita needed someone to talk to, but after many late nights and long chats, Thalita emerged with a new sense of purpose.<br><br><br><br>When Thalita approached him to be a partner in her new venture, a kite-fighting shop called Fun Kites Rio, Renato accepted immediately. Building a business from scratch would be the ultimate puzzle.<br><br><br><br>Renato\u2019s analytical mind helped the shop in those early months. He encouraged Thalita to use her fame as a model to help market the shop and booked her into conventions and symposiums across the country to get the word out on Fun Kites Rio. Over time, the shop built up such a following that when Thalita suggested they stage a kite-fighting tournament, it seemed like a no-brainer.<br><br><br><br>The tournament was a flurry of activity. All day, friends and strangers alike would approach Renato and thank him for his hard work. Kite-fighting meant something to these people, it made their lives better, and Renato contributed to their overall happiness and well-being.<br><br><br><br>Before he knew it, the tournament was over and the moon was high in the sky. It didn\u2019t matter that he was tired or hungry or out in some remote field picking up garbage. It was all worth it.<br><br><br><br>He only stopped cleaning when he noticed something up above: a drone. It made him think of the games he\u2019d play with Thalita growing up, using their kites to take down remote airplanes, kites of people on the beach they didn\u2019t like, and so on. Thalita must have been thinking the same thing. She challenged him to see who could take down the drone. Another chance to show up his sister. The perfect end to the perfect day.<br><br><br><br>But, no. This was a mistake. Renato felt a chill. He tried to stop Thalita, but she was already cheering. The drone ate up her kite and began its crooked, smoking descent into the forest.<br><br><br><br>They were in trouble. It was only when he ran for the forest that Thalita sobered up and followed.<br><br><br><br>It didn\u2019t take long to find the drone imbedded in a tree, kite dangling from its dead rotor blades. The sharp string dug into Renato\u2019s fingers as he worked the knots, he nearly had the kite free when--<br><br><br><br>--a bloody hand reached out from the dark forest and grabbed him!<br><br><br><br>Renato jumped at the sight of the injured man. He was raving, babbling, desperate for help. Renato put his hands out to keep the man from falling. It was already too late.<br><br><br><br>Two blades sliced through the man and along Renato\u2019s arm. There was no time to look down at the wound. The blades were up in the air. The man was cut in half. And a woman, clad in armor, accompanied by a drone \u2013 like the drone Thalita downed \u2013 was standing before him.<br><br><br><br>Renato knew he had to move but he couldn\u2019t. Time was running out. Then he felt another hand on him, pulling him back.<br><br><br><br>Everything was a blur. The cut in his arm was deep and throbbing. But he knew Thalita had him. And he knew he had to run.<br><br><br><br>The night grew cold as they stopped to hide. Renato struggled to regain his breath, but there was no time. As quickly as they stopped, Thalita was pulling him again, towards an abandoned factory.<br><br><br><br>But there are no factories out here, Renato thought to himself.<br><br><br><br>The factory was even colder than the forest. He clutched his arm, trying to stop the bleeding. His head was swimming. How much blood had he lost already? Thalita was guarding him in some dark corner of the factory, and suddenly--<br><br><br><br>--She was pulling Renato to his feet, telling him to run.<br><br><br><br>Run where? She said something about a beach. Renato tried to stop her, tried pulling her back, but he was too weak. He couldn\u2019t see any beach. All he could see was black fog closing in on them.",

But humankind rallied and eventually found a new way forward.<br><br>Inventors and innovators discovered new ways to create energy and grow food. One such visionary founded Huxlee Industries Ltd. Since much of Earth was left uninhabitable and many of the world's resources were dwindling, Huxlee plowed all their profits into research in rocket science, artificial intelligence, and genetic engineering.<br><br>They began exploring the galaxy, looking for habitable planets with valuable resources. Their plan was to travel to the far reaches of the galaxy, mine those precious resources, and create a peaceful and prosperous future for humankind.<br><br>Each planet that humanity colonized was carefully designed. Resources were extracted, and growth hubs were constructed to create individuals fabricated from carefully engineered DNA.<br><br>Each individual was manufactured for a different societal function. The vast majority were manual laborers. Others were created to be scientists, engineers, administrators, agronomists, and physicians. The idea was to create a functional society that would operate flawlessly.<br><br>Gabriel Soma was born in a cloning hub on Proxima Centauri C, the first planet humanity colonized. He was part of a small crew that maintained and repaired the robots and androids sent to construct colonization hubs. Unbeknownst to Gabe, every memory of his childhood was implanted in his consciousness by those who cloned him. Like the rest of his crew, he believed he was born to a mother and father on Earth. Psychological stability was maintained by creating a narrative sequence of a loving family. None knew that they were, in fact, bred in a colonization hub.<br><br>Gabriel\u2019s ship landed on Dvarka, a planet in a recently discovered solar system. Upon their arrival, five human-controlled UAVs and five Hux-A7 fully autonomous robots were sent to explore the planet\u2019s surface<br><br>They detected breathable air and abundant water and many organic lifeforms as well as something unexpected. The ruins of an ancient civilization that had mysteriously disappeared. The ruins seemed ancient, but the tech seemed surprisingly advanced. Whatever powered the tech was a mystery as it clearly was inoperable and long dormant.<br><br>As the planet proved hospitable to human life and contained many valuable mineral resources, construction began on the colonization hub.<br><br>The landing craft contained living quarters for the ten-person human crew. Most of the hub construction was automated, but Huxlee Industries always included a human crew to act in a supervisory capacity.<br><br>The planet possessed great beauty. Old growth forests and meadows covered in colorful flowers. Placid lakes. Wide rivers. Gabe could imagine living on a planet like Dvarka forever. The inspiring beauty and peaceful setting lulled the entire team into complacency. Even Michael, the team security officer.<br><br>Michael was driving a transport vehicle, patrolling the edges of the ruins with Sarah, a science officer charged with documenting the flora and fauna. According to Sarah, the vehicle suddenly accelerated on its own and the brakes lost all function. A cliff loomed ahead and Michael shouted for Sarah to jump, but the doors wouldn\u2019t open. Michael shot out her window and Sarah climbed through and jumped to safety. He shot out his own window but couldn\u2019t get through in time. As he struggled to escape, the vehicle roared off the edge. The hundred-foot drop caused the vehicle\u2019s fuel tank to rupture. Sarah raced to the edge and heard Michael\u2019s terrifying screams as the transport vehicle went up in flames.<br><br>That afternoon, they held a memorial and that night Gabriel had trouble falling asleep. Sometime in the night he bolted awake, unable to breathe. His eyes grew wide as his breath grew short. He gagged as hands flew to his throat. The power was out in the shelter and there was no oxygen. Desperately, he stumbled forward through the dark corridors and only survived by manually opening an emergency door with the last of his strength.<br><br>Six of his fellow crew members weren\u2019t as lucky. With the life support and ventilation system down, they suffocated in their beds. Only Dmitri, the medical officer, managed to survive as he had a tank of oxygen nearby which he also used to save Sarah.<br><br>Later that day, Gabe received a distress call from Sarah. The transmission ended abruptly, and Gabriel went looking for her. He found a blood trail that led to her headless and mutilated corpse near a half-built food hub. Gabe reasoned that there must be some sort of dangerous predator they missed in the initial scan of the area.<br><br>Back at the colonization hub, he studied the logs in the main server to see if they missed anything in their initial recon. Instead, he found something even more troubling. One of the Hux-A7\u2019s apparently took control of the transport vehicle and shut down the life support system on the landing craft.<br><br>Gabriel searched the compound for the errant Hux and found it in the cloning hub. The robot was covered in blood and held the science officer\u2019s head by the hair. The Hux apparently had extracted DNA and was using it to create what seemed to be\u2014<br><br>A new body.<br><br>Instantly, Gabe gave the robot an order that was ignored. He assumed the robot\u2019s source code was corrupted, but when he plugged his scanner into its memory core, he discovered that the original code had been replaced by something completely incomprehensible, written in an alien language he had never seen before.<br><br>Clearly, the Hux needed recalibration. But when Gabe tried to do just that, the HUX released a surge of power that fried all the equipment. When Gabe attempted to remove the robot\u2019s power supply, the Hux grabbed him by the throat and threw him ten feet across the laboratory like a ragdoll.<br><br>At the sound of the commotion, Dmitri rushed in to see the Hux approaching Gabe. He commanded the Hux to power off, but it turned slowly and marched toward him as he yelled codes that were supposed to deactivate the faulty tool. The Hux stared at the shouting officer for a moment, then punched a hole through his chest and pulled out his beating heart. The medical officer fell dead and the Hux extracted blood to add to its design.<br><br>Gabriel quickly gathered himself and bolted out into the alien forest, heading for the fuel hub. There he found a length of steel pipe, hid and waited, but\u2014<br><br>The Hux never showed up.<br><br>Day gave way to dusk and Gabe began to shiver as the sun fell behind the hills. He heard the doors hiss open and watched as the clanking Hux emerged.<br><br>It had fabricated a new body for itself. Part flesh. Part silicon. Part human. Part machine. Massive. Powerful. Beautiful and majestic like\u2014<br><br>An ancient God.<br><br>Gabriel tried to sneak away, but the Hux heard him and quickly trapped him behind a hydrogen generator.<br><br>Pinned, Gabe spotted a liquid hydrogen fuel tank and used the pipe to smash a valve open. The Hux distracted, he quickly escaped, striking the door with the pipe as he fled, creating a spark that ignited the fuel. The flame traveled back to the tank and the hub instantly exploded in a massive fireball, blowing the Hux off its feet.<br><br>Gabe raced across the meadow and into the forest. When he looked back, he saw the Hux emerge from the flames and smoke. Burning. Melting. Shrieking. Deformed. Terrible and wrathful like\u2014<br><br>An ancient God.<br><br>The forest canopy kept out the light of the moon and Gabe rushed into a thick creeping fog before the Hux could find him.<br><br>Consume him.<br><br>Assimilate him.",

Nicolas Cage had done it all and seen it all.<br><br>Or so he thought.<br><br>The last script to cross his desk was something new entirely. Descend Beyond. As he pored over every word, every page, Nick became more and more transfixed. It was as if the script had consumed his senses entirely.

He could hear rumbling as the walls glowed and released\u2014<br><br>Nick called his agent immediately. By the time the sun rose, he was on a private jet bound for the Pacific. His agent had warned him that Descend Beyond was backed by some questionable financers. Nick didn\u2019t mind. He was willing to do the film for free, but his agent talked him out of it.<br><br>Touching down, Nick wondered if the rocky island was under lockdown. The dirt runway was flanked by research tents bearing a logo he did not recognize. As soon as he stepped off the jet, he was lead by armed guards to the director of Descend Beyond, a white-haired woman with the hardness of a government agent: Pauline Stamper.<br><br>Stamper herself drove Nick to set, with another two black jeeps following them. The dirt road went through an abandoned camp, along the edge of a waterfall, and switchbacked down to a valley of dense forests. Stamper lead Nick and the guards on foot to the film\u2019s key location: an ominous cave, home to the crumbling ruins of an ancient temple.<br><br>It was exactly what he had seen as he read the script in his office. The dark temple. The stone altar in the middle of the main chamber. The smooth walls waiting to glow. Waiting to unleash\u2014<br><br>Nick was ready to film immediately. Stamper gently reminded him that filming would commence the following morning, but Nick refused to hear any of it. The crew was quickly summoned, and just as the sun began to set, Nick heard the words he longed to hear:<br><br>Action!<br><br>Nick performed his dialogue to the letter. A dark incantation that rolled off his tongue with ease. He dipped his fingers in a cup of red ink and painted symbols on the stone altar. He never felt this way on a set before. But then\u2026<br><br>Nick looked up and saw the temple walls glowing, revealing symbols like the one he had painted on the altar. Nick had thought the glowing would be a special effect added to the film in post. Something was wrong.<br><br>He approached the wall and touched the symbols. Just like it said in the script. He stared in disbelief as black fog -- real black fog -- billowed from the symbols and wrapped around his arm. This had to be a practical joke. He looked behind the camera, expecting to see Stamper and her crew laughing at their little prank.<br><br>But they were gone. And the black fog was all around him.<br><br>This can\u2019t be real.

		"story": "Sable figured she had to be adopted. No way was she the progeny of her insanely perky mom and her grinning, golf-playing, frat boy of a dad. They didn\u2019t understand the first thing about her. No one in Greenville did. Except for Mikaela. They were fast friends since third grade. Up until then Sable had no friends. She wasn\u2019t into ponies or dolls or tea parties with teddy bears. She liked bugs, lizards, riding bikes and dirt clod fights. Her favorite holiday was Halloween and Mikaela was the only one who didn\u2019t think she was crazy when she dyed her hair purple in eighth grade. Sable\u2019s mom was furious. Her dad didn\u2019t even notice. Mikaela went with her to the mall when she got her ears pierced and helped her pick out her first tattoo. An occult symbol hidden in a place her parents would never see. Mikaela declined to get her own tattoo. She flirted with the dark side, but she didn\u2019t live it. Not like Sable. The dark side made sense to Sable, and she reveled in it. Partly because it freaked out her parents and teachers. Partly because it felt like who she was. Some called her a goth because of the way she presented herself. But she wasn\u2019t into labels. She loved horror movies and found the occult exciting. It made sense to her. She knew that the shiny suburban world of her mom and dad had a dark underbelly. They were afraid to confront their fear, so they pretended everything was perfect and that they would live forever. But Sable knew better. Death stalked us all and no one was getting out alive.<br><br>Mikaela got Sable a job at Moonstone. Probably the only place in town that would have hired her. She took classes at the local college and produced a guerilla radio show on the shortwave in her attic. All Things Wicked This Night was about the world\u2019s dark underbelly. The occult. Urban legends. Horror. And often there were heated discussions with Mikaela about the horror movies they\u2019d catch at the only theater in Greenville. Mikaela liked her horror with a little comedy, but Sable liked it meaner. Scarier. Bloodier. She relished the gore. Enjoyed the terror. Liked to feel the adrenaline rush. And their debates were entertaining to say the least.<br><br>When searching for inspiration for her show, Sable would take walks in the cemetery with all the statues and headstones of early settlers who had founded the town as a sanctuary for those escaping persecution. She often talked about that history on her show, and she formed a theory that the uncanny sightings and disappearances were somehow linked to the town\u2019s history. One caller suggested the town was built on top of a fracture. The caller went on to describe a fracture as an overlap between worlds. Another caller said these fractures were created by an ancient cult devoted to forgotten demons. Another caller defined fractures as a cosmic buffet for an elder god that fed on pain, fear, and misery. And one caller even argued that it wasn\u2019t a fracture but The Unknown, a mysterious creature that consumed anyone who dared to imagine it. All the theories made for fun and inspiring debates, and she loved nothing more than to discuss real-life horror until the horror became personal.<br><br>One evening Sable had challenged Mikaela to tell a real horror story at Moonstone\u2019s Annual Halloween Festival. Scare the crap out of people. Stop dancing around the horror and embrace it. Tell a story about The Unknown. Make them imagine it. Make them believe The Unknown will show up on stage. Nothing terrifies an audience more than a show that could potentially kill them. Mikaela laughed at the idea and declined the challenge because she was working on another story with her roommate.<br><br>But a strange, black fog had taken Mikaela during her performance and Sable felt the icy hand of guilt grab her by the back of the neck. She was convinced that she had somehow sent Mikaela to her doom. Did The Unknown take her? Did she try to define The Unknown? What about her roommate? Her roommate disappeared as well. But then she realized Mikaela\u2019s story wasn\u2019t about The Unknown. It was about something else. Another dimension. A dimension filled with terrifying creatures, sadistic killers, and endless horror.<br><br>This was not The Unknown.<br><br>With this realization, Sable began to investigate other disappearances in Greenville. Before long, she realized most of the disappearances occurred at the theater or somewhere close by. Investigating further, she discovered the theater was built over the ruins of an old, one-room schoolhouse that had burned to the ground in the 1920s. Somehow the students couldn\u2019t get out and everyone perished in the flames. Feeling close to an answer, she continued her research and discovered two teenage brothers had recently disappeared from the theater. Elias and Elan. The only witness, their younger sister, Ellen, was committed to an institution after ripping her eyes out. And so, pretending to be a relative, Sable went to talk to Ellen who admitted she and her brothers had been trying to steal old movie posters from the storage room behind the movie screen. She then described a secret door in the basement and a passageway that led to another place.<br><br>A dark place.<br><br>A cold place.<br><br>An evil place.<br><br>Stay away from there, she begged. Stay away.<br><br>But Sable wasn\u2019t about to stay away.<br><br>Not after that story.<br><br>Determined to see Mikaela again, Sable hitched a ride to the theater and soon found the door behind the movie screen. In the darkness she jimmied the door open with a crowbar and headed down a creaking, wooden stairway to the dank cellar. A light switch activated flickering fluorescent lights that illuminated a room filled with broken theater seats and old movie posters dating back eighty years. She searched the sprawling basement and found a thick wooden door hidden behind a poster of the original Frankenstein. She pushed and shoved the door open to reveal an endless circular stairway descending into perfect darkness. Using a penlight to navigate, she descended for ten minutes before she noticed the cold, black fog rising from the lower depths.<br><br>The same cold, black fog that had taken Mikaela.<br><br>Sable considered running back up the stairs to where she would be safe. But then she thought about the terrifying creatures and the sadistic killers and the endless horror, and she quickly decided she wasn\u2019t going to let her best friend have all the fun.",

A bard's purpose in life was to celebrate triumph over adversity. A world without evil would be a world with no new songs to sing.<br><br>Aestri knew what she had to do. She scoped out the taverns and back alleys of the city, looking for adventurers willing to help her and Baermar find the source of this strange new magic. Many turned her down - why would she want evil to return to the land? But using her wit and charisma, Aestri was able to inspire enough townsfolk to join her in restoring the balance between good and evil.<br><br>Together, this ragtag troupe of adventurers traveled through swamplands and under mountains. They were driven out of towns by those who believed the troupe was secretly in league with the evil that had been eradicated. And every so often, folks would be kind enough to provide food, shelter, and most importantly, information. Baermar eagerly wrote down every clue and rumor they heard and concluded that the source of this strange magic must lie near the Kingdom of Keoland, where people spoke of an ancient tower emerging from its ruins, being instantly rebuilt bigger and stronger than it was before.<br><br>Their suspicions were confirmed as the troupe made their way south. Villagers spoke of the tower -- and its lord -- in hushed tones, but Aestri knew the place by its reputation. They were traveling to the Rotted Tower, stronghold of the Arch-Lich Vecna.<br><br>As they drew closer and closer to the Rotted Tower, the troupe could feel evil magic in the air. They steeled themselves for a fight with Vecna, but were shocked to find the Rotted Tower was completely empty. They made their way up the spiral staircase, passing window after window of shattered stained glass, until they reached the top of the tower. Amidst the debris, Aestri found a hastily-written scroll.<br><br>Baermar was eager to show off his proficiency in arcana. He studied the scroll and realized the words were an incantation, written phonetically. As he sang the words aloud, the tower began to rumble. Black fog crept in through the stone floor. Aestri stopped Baermar from his recitation, but it was too late. The fog took hold of the adventurers, and within moments they were gone.",

When the opportunity arose to go on an archaeological expedition to the island of Yamatai, Lara jumped at the chance. Her mentor, Conrad Roth, selected her and Sam to be a part of the trip. Before they reached the island, everything went sideways. Their ship hit a storm and split in two, scattering the expedition across the island\u2019s shore. Lara struggled to find her crew while avoiding the pursuit of the nefarious Solarii Brotherhood who infested the island. She managed to find Sam with a seemingly marooned inhabitant named Mathias, but when Lara passed out, Sam and Mathias disappeared. As she pursued Sam, she learned that the Brotherhood was looking for a vessel for an ancient queen, and, led by Mathias, became convinced that vessel was Sam. When Lara finally tracked them to a cave under a waterfall, they had Sam tied to a pyre, preparing to test whether she was the one\u2014or if she would simply burn to death. In a desperate attempt to save Sam, Lara let loose an arrow, taking out the torchbearer. But she was outnumbered and promptly captured and beaten by the Brotherhood. As two guards led her over a natural stone bridge, an unnatural black fog enveloped them. Her captors distracted, she broke free and leapt from the bridge into the river of blood below. As she sank, dozens of limbs reached out at her, grabbed her, tore away her bow, pulled her under. It was as if the river was alive. She kicked and struggled to reach the surface. At last, she emerged from the sick viscera and found herself in an entirely new nightmare.",

With no other option, Sally had to find a way but the only employment she could get was at the Crotus Prenn Asylum. She started at the bottom, doing the hard night shift. Over the years, her mind had reached its limits, decades of seeing horrid things that violate the eyes. Finally, she could not take it anymore and concepts of purification emerged inside her. As the morning staff arrived one day in September, they found over fifty patients dead in their beds, and four staff members, also dead. Only Sally had survived the night but her mind was gone, rocking back and forth non-stop. They got her into an ambulance, but that ambulance never reached the hospital. It was found crashed in a nearby wood, all the staff dead and Sally nowhere to be found.",

Lisa was particularly fond of the charms they taught her to draw for safety and good fortune. One night, as she was walking home through the woods, a terrible storm struck without warning. In the slick wet darkness, she lost her footing and struck her head. Slipping in and out of consciousness, she watched dark shapes approach between the trees. Soon they were close enough for her to make out their evil, hungry grins.<br><br>They kept her chained to the wall in a flooded cellar. Through the gloom, she could see others, whose open wounds swarmed with flies. They did not survive long once the cannibals began carving bites from their bodies with their rusted blades, but somehow Lisa persisted. Starved and mutilated, her gaunt arms became loose in their shackles. She pulled, and the metal tore through skin and muscle until she was free. Her flesh oozed viscous yellow pus and bones were visible beneath gangrenous wounds. She could go no further. Delirious, she thought of home; she thought of the elders. She traced the symbols they had taught her. A dark hunger stirred inside her. It yearned for blood. She chose vengeance.<br><br>The police search eventually brought them to the old house in the swamp. Its inhabitants had been dismembered and devoured. The elders\u2019 charms were scrawled in blood on the floor. Lisa\u2019s body was never found.<br>",

		"story": "As soon as Anna was able to walk, her mother started teaching her how to survive a harsh, solitary life in the northern woods. Living in such an extremely remote and dangerous area required skill and resilience. When sunlight became too dim for productive activities, they would take refuge in their house, a sturdy old cabin constructed to resist the toughest winters. Close to the hearth\u2019s warmth, Anna would rest in her mother\u2019s arms, surrounded by the few wooden toys and masks she had crafted for her. Drifting off to sleep with stories and lullabies, she dreamt happy dreams, ignorant of the events that would soon change everything.<br><br>Anna and her mother were stalking a great elk through the woods. They knew it was dangerous prey, but it had been a particularly difficult winter and they were almost out of food. The specter of starvation frightened them more than any forest creature. Without warning, the elk reared, bellowed and charged at Anna. She was paralyzed with fear as the whole world seemed to shake under the immense beast's pounding hooves. The elk was close enough for Anna to see the murderous fury in its eyes when her mother threw herself in its path, axe in hand. A bloodcurdling scream escaped from her lips as the elk impaled her upon its antlers and hoisted her into the air. With all her strength, she brought her axe down on its head again and again while it tried to shake her loose. With a sickening crack, the antlers snapped and Anna's mother was free. The beast collapsed.<br><br>Anna was too small to move her mother's broken body, so she sat with her in the clearing where she had fallen. To distract her from the dying elk's cries, Anna's mother held her and hummed her favorite lullaby. They stayed like that, the huntress and the elk getting quieter and colder, until Anna was alone in the silent forest. Eventually she stood up and started the long walk back home.<br><br>Still a child, she knew just enough about life in the frozen forest to survive. She followed her instincts and became one with the wild. She got older and stronger and practiced her hunt. As she grew into a dangerous predator, her humanity became a half-remembered dream.<br><br>She widened her territory and lived off her hunts. She worked her way up through squirrels and hares and mink and foxes. Eventually she grew tired of them and hunted more dangerous animals like wolves and bears. When unsuspecting travelers came through her woods, she discovered her new favorite prey: humans. Unlucky souls who strayed into her territory were slaughtered like any other animal. She liked to collect their tools and colorful garments and especially toys when there were little ones. But she could never bring herself to kill the little girls.<br><br>Girls she would take back to her house, deep in the woods. They were precious, and looking at them woke up something deep in her heart. She craved the closeness of a loved one, a child of her own. Among the pillaged wooden toys, dolls and story books she couldn\u2019t read, the girls would be tied by the neck with a rough and chafing rope fastened firmly to the wall. She couldn\u2019t let them wander off, or they would surely die outside.<br><br>Every time, the girls would waste away and die of cold or starvation or sickness. Every time, it plunged Anna deeper into pain and sorrow and madness. She was compelled to try again, and started raiding the nearest villages to slaughter families and kidnap their daughters. She wore one of the animal masks her mother crafted for her so many years earlier to try to calm the frightened children. Villagers spread the legend of a half-beast lurking in Red Forest: The Huntress, who killed men and ate little girls.<br><br>War eventually came to the forest. German soldiers began to pass through, on the march to attack the collapsing Russian Empire. During these dark times, there were no more travelers. The villagers had abandoned their homes, and no more little ones to be found; only soldiers. Many of them were found with violent axe wounds. Whole groups disappeared mysteriously. Once the war was over, the rumours of The Huntress disappeared with it, engulfed by the Red Forest.",

His Grandpa and Ma used to care for them all, but Grandpa is old now and she has been still for a while, so Leatherface and his brothers had to take over. Family is everything to him. Family is security and safety.<br><br>But, even though he did his best, one of the kids got away. He tried to stop her, chasing after her as fast as he could, but she had help: another outsider, driving a truck. The evil trucker killed his brother, ran him over like he was a possum. In a fury, Leatherface leapt at him, the saw ready to avenge his family, but the trucker was too quick. He knocked Leatherface aside and turned his own saw against him.<br><br>As he watched the outsiders driving away, the rage, grief and pain combined with the worry about what would happen to his family now. They would surely return with the police, and the police would take his brothers, his Grandpa. Without them, what would he do? Without their commands, he would wither and die.<br><br>As his world collapsed, Leatherface spun in circles, swinging the saw all around, trying to fight off the myriad external threats that surrounded him.<br><br>Then another feeling overtook him. It came from outside his vision, crawling over his skin with cold dread. He realised that no matter what outsiders could do to him, there was something worse, something bigger that lived in the shadows. He was filled with a terror unlike any he had ever felt before. But it was almost comforting, like the fear he\u2019d felt with his family. The fear of disappointing them.<br><br>He was brought to a place that was familiar but unknowable, and he instinctively knew what he had to do. He couldn\u2019t fail it, the way he had his family. Outsiders would come but he would use his skills to overcome any threats. There would be screaming, but he could make the world quiet again.

They thought fire had rid them of a monster that night, that their children were finally safe, but evil as strong as his has a way of surviving.<br><br>Years passed, the horror was buried, the victims mercifully forgot. Then, somehow, Freddy returned, and dreams became nightmares once again.<br><br>Freddy focused his anger on those he felt had wronged him, building up to his one true obsession: Nancy Holbrook. But he underestimated her strength and resourcefulness. Together with her friend, Quentin, she managed to weaken Freddy, mutilating him and leaving him for dead once more.<br><br>Death didn't want Freddy the first time he encountered it, why did they think it would take him now? He emerged once more, consumed with vengeance. Then he turned his sights on the boy who had blocked his path to Nancy, his number one.<br><br>Freddy invaded Quentin's dreams, terrorizing him night after night, until his strength and defenses would be at their lowest. When the time was right, he forced the boy to return to the dark reflection of Badham Preschool. Here he would have his final revenge.<br><br>Freddy stalked the boy through the school's halls. He took his time, savoring every moment of the hunt. This was what he enjoyed the most: the smell of their sweat in the air, the ragged gasps of their terrified breath. They were his to play with.<br><br>There was the boy, at the end of a long corridor. Too tired and scared to run anymore? Resigned to his fate? Freddy closed in, arms wide, claws raking the wall. Their tips traced along a pipe, the metallic shrieking only adding to the boy\u2019s apprehension.<br><br>A shower of sparks rained on the ground, and into the liquid that covered the tiled floor. A blue flame blossomed and quickly engulfed the room.<br><br>The boy took flight as Freddy burst from the flames in a fury. Rooms and walls raced past in a blur until they were in Freddy's basement. There would be no escape from here.<br><br>Slowly Freddy closed in on the boy. His fear was so strong now that Freddy could almost taste it, but his eyes burned with a defiant hatred that was almost admirable.<br><br>Freddy drew back his claws.<br><br>Then Freddy felt another presence with him; something old, powerful and dark. A miasma enveloped him and the only sensation was a sound like wooden beams flexing and creaking in the distance. The echoing groan of metal crushed against metal. Something arcane and unknowable, half-way between language and pure terror.<br><br>There was a moment of falling and spinning, and then Freddy was back in the school. But not his school. It looked the same, but it felt different. His powers were tempered in some ways and focused in others. The boy had gone for now, but other prey walked the hallways.

		"story": "When John Kramer, better known as Jigsaw, planned for his son to be born during the Chinese Zodiac\u2019s Year of the Pig, he wanted it to represent fertility and rebirth; a new beginning for him and his wife, and the start of a charmed life for his son. But that plan was shattered on the night that a junkie broke into his wife\u2019s clinic, hoping to score.<br><br>After this event resulted in the death of his unborn son, John finally caught up with the junkie, making him his first test subject, and the Pig was changed forever too. It became a representation of the disease that was rotting John from the inside, a reminder that we are just meat unless we elevate ourselves through our actions, by grasping life from the jaws of death.<br><br>The Pig became a vessel, an agent of Jigsaw, conveying the subjects to their test. For some of those who emerged victorious, the Pig could still be a rebirth, into their new lives as apprentices, even disciples, of Jigsaw.<br><br>That was the case for Amanda Young, a troubled soul, whose life had been a catalogue of harm, both to herself and those around her.

She failed the test and took a bullet as a consequence.<br><br>Bleeding out on the tiled floor, darkness engulfed Amanda\u2019s vision, accompanied by a sound like creaking wood. Then she was in a forest, once more viewing the world through the eyes of a Pig. Trees surrounded her, their branches clawing at her from all sides. Waves of panic washed over her and she could hear her breath reverberating inside the mask.<br><br>Had she been damned, cursed to spend her days here, in this guise? Or maybe this was another test? Maybe she hadn\u2019t failed at all? John always thought one step ahead of everyone else, planned for every eventuality, and he would never give up on her, surely?<br><br>Jigsaw may have gone but he had passed her onto another. A being for whom she would be The Pig again.<br><br>Ultimately, she saw now that she had been right in the choices she had made. The time for games was over. There was no chance of redemption for any of them. They were meat, and meat was destined for slaughter.",

		"story": "Kenneth Chase was born in 1932 by a difficult labor, which his mother wouldn\u2019t survive. This event drove a rift between him and his father that never closed. As the boy grew, so did his father\u2019s resentment, and his drinking habit. By the time Kenneth was at school, they lived mostly separate lives.<br><br>Academically, he was unremarkable, coasting by on his significant athletic prowess. He grew tall and strong, excelling at track events, but shunned any attempts to coax him into team sports.<br><br>On his walk home from school, he would often find feathers on the ground and he soon began a collection, keeping them in a cigar box under his bed. With his father either at work or in an alcohol-induced stupor, Kenneth had hours to spend alone, transfixed by the regularity of the feathers\u2019 barbs and feeling the softness as he ran them over his lips. Watching the birds that came to the feeder in his garden, he imagined how soft they must be and resolved to catch one. He ingratiated himself with the local dentist, soon procuring some anesthetic. Using this, he rigged up a trap on the feeder, that he hoped would knock out a bird long enough that he could touch it.<br><br>After a few failed attempts, he managed to trap a robin. As it lay in his hand, he felt a sudden rush, of a life at his mercy. He had planned to release it once it recovered from the anesthetic. Instead, as its eyes flickered back into consciousness and it began to struggle, his grip remained firm. His fingers slowly tightened around its throat, squeezing until its chest feathers were finally still. He disposed of the body, keeping just a feather, with which he started a new collection, discarding the others as \u2018fake\u2019.<br><br>By the late 1940s, Kenneth had left school and started working as a busboy at a local diner. He had also escalated to larger prey, like squirrels, raccoons and dogs, becoming skilled at customizing the anesthetic dosage for each.<br><br>In early 1954, a young man went missing and the town was turned upside down in the search. A few months later, Kenneth\u2019s father, while doing some work in the crawlspace under the house, found a cigar box. He broke it open and saw, to his horror, that it contained feathers, animal paws, and a man\u2019s finger.<br><br>Returning from work, Kenneth saw his father leaving the crawlspace with a cigar box in his hands. He turned on his heel and never went home again.<br><br>After a few weeks of living rough, he encountered a traveling circus and, with his prodigious strength, was hired to work the ropes. He assumed a new name: Jeffrey Hawk.<br><br>Suddenly surrounded by a close-knit community, \u201cJeffrey\u201d had to learn to socialize. He donned a new personality like a disguise, quickly becoming known as charming and helpful, and was welcomed into his new family.<br><br>Over the next decade, he stayed with the circus, traveling the length and breadth of the USA. But, with the itinerant life providing few repercussions, he fell into bad habits. Drink, junk food, drugs, he indulged all of them to excess. For a time, these vices were enough, but then his old urges returned and his nomadic existence became a cover for him to resume killing. He stole clothes and makeup from performers, fashioning a disguise that would let him get close to his victims before he anesthetized them, bringing them back to his caravan, where they would awake to find themselves bound and at his mercy. He would finally get to have his fun, mentally and physically torturing them, their screams fueling him, before being lost in the night.<br><br>Once their strength was at its lowest, he would carefully examine their fingers, searching for the prettiest, running them over his tongue to find the tastiest. Once he found the best, he would cut it from their hand and proudly add it to his collection, disposing of the rest of the body as pointless waste.<br><br>Men, women, young, old, he didn\u2019t care. The essence of a good collection is in the variety, in the memories and stories they evoke.<br><br>He removed the costume less and less, shedding his old personality with it, fully embracing the clown, his true self.<br><br>With time, he became complacent and sloppy. A victim managed to work free of her bindings while he was sleeping off the drink. She escaped, screaming for help, and he awoke to find the rest of the circus bearing down on him. He whipped his horse and the caravan disappeared into the night.<br><br>Since then he has roamed the country, a parasite who could always be found at a carnival or circus, but who would never been seen on any playbill. He lured those brave, or foolish, enough to come near, trapped them and moved on before they could be found missing.<br><br>Somewhere along the way, he left the ordinary roads of the USA behind him, traveling through a veil of mist and entering a new realm. It was a place of transience and impermanence, perfectly suiting the life he had chosen to lead. Feeling more at home than he had in his entire life, he set up camp and waited for his first visitor.",

She studied Education at Takamatsu, a private university, which weighed heavily on her family\u2019s shaky finances. Her mother got ill that year and the bills started piling up. Rin worked part-time in a futile attempt to help lighten the load.<br><br>Her father faced a debt that grew without end. He started working double-shifts in hopes of obtaining a promotion. That\u2019s when he started losing sleep. A dark whisper would keep him awake all night, reminding him of his hopeless situation. Exhausted, he started to lose grasp of reality. Fighting to deny what the voice whispered at night, Rin\u2019s father made a desperate move. He met with his superior and explained his situation. He begged for a bonus, an advance, time-off---anything.<br><br>His request was denied. The company had launched a defective production line that was costing them dearly. Someone had to be held accountable and Rin\u2019s father fitted the bill perfectly. He was fired after twenty-two years of service.<br><br>That evening, Rin came home from work. She\u2019d stayed late to entertain customers that lingered at the restaurant. As she parked her bike in the shed, she heard her mother\u2019s scream from the house.<br><br>She rushed in, climbing up the stairs to her parents\u2019 room. There she found bits and pieces of her mother on the floor. Her limbs were clean-cut, tangled up in an unnatural position. Her breasts were sliced up, revealing her rib cage, which was cracked open. Rin gagged.<br><br>A sharp katana came crashing down. Rin blocked the blade, which bit into her bare forearm. The shock of recognition interrupted her pain: her father was wielding the katana with a stoic expression. She cried out to make him stop, but he slashed her arm again.<br><br>She rushed off and slid on the blood-smeared floor. Using the doorframe as support, she raised herself up. The katana ripped through the wall, cleaving her other arm. She screamed in pain as she limped into the hallway, only to be met by her father\u2019s blade.<br><br>She stepped back, trembling, as she held together the soft loose flesh of her abdomen. Images of her mother\u2019s tangled limbs flashed before her eyes.<br><br>Rin charged at her father, making him stumble back. He punched her torn abdomen and she reclined in pain. As she struggled to get back up, he slashed her thigh, making her collapse on the floor.<br><br>As she crawled towards the stairs, he grabbed her hair and yanked her against a partition. The glass shattered on impact and she fell through, landing one floor down.<br><br>She heard footsteps somewhere above her. With effort, she moved, worming her way into a sea of broken glass. The shards gnawed at her, ripping her flesh. He had to be stopped. He would not get away with what he\u2019d done to her\u2014with what he\u2019d done to her mother.<br><br>Coughing up blood, her chin grazed the glass, adding to the bleeding.

		"story": "Frank Morrison was nineteen and had little to show for it. He\u2019d stopped attending school after being kicked out of the basketball team for shoving a referee into the stands. Yet Frank was a man of potential, who could light up a room despite his bleak childhood. At six years old, he\u2019d been taken away from Calgary to start a circuit of foster homes. No matter how many times he\u2019d lashed out, threw tantrums and got into fights, they\u2019d kept moving him to new, unfamiliar houses. His last move had been three years prior when his last foster dad, Clive Andrews, had picked him up from the adoption center. They\u2019d been on the road for seven hours before reaching a small bungalow in Ormond. It would be the longest time they\u2019d spend together. Clive was too busy trading cheques from Family Services for drinks at the bar.<br><br>Ormond was a small, stale place; a remote town of six thousand inhabitants where gray winters drag on for most of the year. Frank did everything he could to get into another adoptive family, but he changed his mind when he caught the attention of a beautiful girl. Julie was a popular girl who was convinced that she deserved better than a life in Ormond, and Frank, as an outsider, was her ticket out. Frank attended the parties she threw where everyone was younger than him and easily impressed, which he liked. He met the impulsive Joey, who liked to show off, and the shy, naive Susie, who was Julie\u2019s best friend.<br><br>They would hang out at an abandoned lodge up Mount Ormond. Their time together was the perfect break from the boring conformity of their small, insignificant everyday lives. Frank saw it as an opportunity to shape their lack of experience into something powerful. He lined up nights of debauchery and rampage, testing their limits. Bullying, vandalism, and theft were essentially their weekend plans. It came to a point where they would do anything he asked. Nothing was off-limits when they put their masks on. One evening, Frank dared Joey to vandalize the store that had recently fired him. They snuck inside easily enough as the building was supposed to be empty after closing hours. But a cleaner who was still there grabbed Julie as soon as she came near. Hearing her stifled cries, a dark impulse took over Frank. He rushed to her aid knife in hand and, without hesitating, planted the blade into the cleaner\u2019s back.<br><br>As the group stared at Frank in shock, he ordered them to finish the job. Joey clenched his jaw, grabbed the knife, and stabbed the bleeding man in the ribs. Susie didn\u2019t want to do it. Frank shouted at her; they had to finish what they\u2019d started. Julie closed her eyes and jabbed the knife into the man\u2019s chest. She handed the wet blade to Susie: they were all in this together now. Susie stared at Julie in disbelief as Frank grabbed her trembling hands and inserted the knife deep into the man\u2019s throat. Frank told them to move fast: they mopped the blood off the floor, stashed the body in the trunk of Joey\u2019s car and drove up Mount Ormond.<br><br>All four were digging in the muddy snow to dispose of the body when Frank spotted something moving through the woods. He grabbed his knife and broke from the group to check it out. The Fog thickened around Frank, becoming so dense that he soon could no longer see ahead. He retraced his steps and stumbled on an ominous trail. He followed the eerie path, as if called by the darkness. Julie, Susie, and Joey finished digging but Frank was nowhere to be seen. Julie spotted his muddy footsteps in the snow and the three of them followed the trail, which took them deeper into the woods. When Julie, Susie, and Joey did not return home that night, their parents thought they\u2019d run away with Frank. Each family came up with a different theory. The mood of the town changed, however, when a body was found by an abandoned lodge up Mount Ormond.",

		"story": "When she was five years old, Adiris, the youngest of a family of seven, was left on the brick-red burning steps of the Temple of Purgation at the center of Babylon. To process her shock and sorrow, she held onto the belief that the gods had a plan for her. Her new life was one of quiet servitude. She would tend to the gardens, prepare ceremonial meals, and polish ceremonial incense burners. At night, she would pray for a sign that would reveal her purpose.<br><br>When she came of age, she attended the high-ranking priests during the yearly worshiping of the sea-goat, the god of water and creation. Swinging a censer down the great hypostyle hall, she cast thick black fumes that reached the cold towering stone pillars before dissipating. Her worries lifted, and the resulting bliss made her feel closer to the gods than ever. She worked herself to the bone each day that followed, fulfilling her duties while taking on new ones, as she aided the priests during purification rituals.<br><br>The priests were more and more in need of assistance. Cleansings were being performed daily to answer the demand from outside the high temple walls, where a catastrophic plague had resurfaced. Within months, the priests contracted the disease. It did not take long before they became too weak to perform any kind of ritual. Adiris, having assisted many purification rituals, was the only one able to carry on. The swelling panic had to be contained, even if by a novice.<br><br>Anxious before her first ceremony, Adiris visited the priests\u2019s sanctuary chamber. When she lit the candles, she noticed a narrow opening at the back. Sliding through the gap, she reached a crypt hidden under the sanctuary. The chamber was bare except for the golden statue of a woman, who stood with outstretched hands, her fingers covered in jewels. It was the sign Adiris had been waiting for.<br><br>The great hall was packed with followers who bowed down as Adiris entered. She strode to the brick altar and grabbed a ceremonial dagger forged in silver, her ruby ringed fingers wrapping around the blade like claws. The sudden display of luxury intrigued the followers, who were struck already by her youth and beauty.<br><br>As she began reciting the epic of creation, a woman at the back swooned and collapsed. Adiris rushed to her and noticed the black blisters covering her feet. Without hesitation, Adiris grabbed her sacred blade and swung it at her own foot, severing a toe. Then she offered the bloody part to the gods, asking them to protect the woman. A silence fell over the followers, who revered Adiris as their new priestess.<br><br>Tales of her wealth, beauty, and devotion began to spread across the city as quickly as the disease. Soon, Adiris\u2019s followers called her the High Priestess of Babylon.<br><br>But her faith was tried when she showed the first signs of infection; her cough became a mix of phlegm and blood, her neck erupted in abscesses, and her four-toed foot darkened. Ashamed of her condition, she began wearing a veiled headpiece and carried a censer that masked the rancid smell of sick that clang to her skin. Hoping to be saved, she kept performing the rituals, offering blessed water and food to her followers.<br><br>But no ritual could save her. In a desperate attempt to appease the gods, Adiris banished herself from the city. She traveled north with a few followers, venturing through the cold woodlands of Urashtu, until it was no longer possible to walk.<br><br>They camped in a damp cave, where Adiris lay in a pool of vomit. Her foot, which had turned black, was so swollen she could not go any further. Her followers and she realized the truth in that cave: they were all infected with the plague.<br><br>Kneeling among her retching followers, Adiris made one last prayer. The black fumes of incense rose into the damp air before being wiped off by a cold breeze.<br><br>Neither the body of Adiris nor her followers were ever found. Many told tales of her return, but no one truly knew what fate had befallen the High Priestess of Babylon.",

		"story": "Danny Johnson, known as Jed Olsen by some, grabbed the newspaper from the kitchen counter: it was a week old, but his face was on the front page, grainy and sunken. It was one of those muggy afternoons in Florida when heat and humidity permeated everything in the kitchen, making him sweat while standing still. He slouched in a damp chair to read. This article had better be good\u2014his work in Roseville had been outstanding.<br><br><i><b>GHOST FACE DISAPPEARS</b></i><br><br>June 18, 1993<br><br>At first glance, Jed Olsen was a modest and enthusiastic freelancer with experience in a variety of small newspapers. The staff at the Roseville Gazette appreciated how easy-going and honest he seemed, and so he was treated as a stranger for no more than five minutes into his interview:<br><br>\u201cJed quickly spotted the editor-in-chief in the room, gave him a wide smile and a firm handshake, and talked about good old American values. And that was it, he was in.\u201d\u2014Ex-Contributor at the Roseville Gazette<br><br>Olsen never justified his erratic career path, which zigzagged between several small towns from Utah to Pennsylvania. There was no verification of his previous jobs. He had a decent portfolio plus a good attitude, and they needed a contributor right away.<br><br><b>THE ROSEVILLE MURDERS</b><br><br>Olsen had been working at the newspaper for five months when the Roseville Murders began: victims from young to old, stabbed to death in their homes. From the reports, the victims seemed chosen at random, yet the killer knew his way around in the houses. The multiple stab wounds indicated a personal motive. No traces of DNA were found. The local police were confounded: the murders were carried with fury akin to a crime of passion yet coldly premeditated.<br><br>The murderer also liked to stalk his targets. Two victims had reported being followed on their way home by a dark figure, a few days prior their death. The killer would follow them from Walleyes, a small bar in Northern Roseville, and snap pictures of them at home, while looking for a way in. He could watch the same victim for weeks, meticulously registering their habits and routines. When he felt the urge to kill, he\u2019d visit the most vulnerable victim on his list, and break inside the house quietly.<br><br>The whole staff worked on the Roseville Murders story. Olsen was often sent to interview the family of victims and relay official statements from the police. Unknown to everyone at the time, his involvement added to the final body count.<br><br><b>THE GHOST FACE</b><br><br>Panic swelled in Roseville when Olsen produced footage of a hooded figure breaking into a house at night. The masked face, a white blur in the dark, stared at the camera for a second, before disappearing inside. \u201cGhost Face Caught on Tape\u201d was the resulting article, written by Olsen. He seemed proud of his work at the time, enjoying how the whole town feared his ghost stories.<br><br>Weeks later, Olsen left a note on his work desk and disappeared:<br><br>\u201cI hope you liked my stories--I enjoyed bringing them to life. Don\u2019t worry, I'm not done.\u201d \u2013Jed Olsen<br><br>The Roseville law enforcement still refuses to comment as Jed Olsen remains at large.<br><br>Danny smiled, ripping out the article from the newspaper. When the investigation had been pointing to him, he\u2019d packed his bags and left Roseville swiftly.<br><br>He got up, the clammy seat pulling his skin. An oppressive humidity engulfed him as he entered the bedroom. Condensation dribbled on a small misted-up window as bits of cracked wallpaper hung limply. Its floral pattern was covered with gruesome photos and newspaper headlines. Danny pinned the week-old article on top of a picture of lacerated scalps. A faint pang of hunger hit him, and he wondered when he had eaten last. Was it this morning, while washing his knife and clothes? Or was it last night, after following that girl down the street? He couldn\u2019t remember clearly.<br><br>Taking a step back, he admired his work on the wall. His mind drifted, remembering all the articles he\u2019d written, the stories he\u2019d planned, and the scenes he\u2019d brought to life.<br><br>A shiver ran through him. A chilling breeze transformed the bedroom's humidity into an opaque, freezing Fog. A woman shrieked. Dead leaves crunched under his feet.<br><br>He smiled in anticipation.",

		"story": "Honoring his family name was never enough for Kazan Yamaoka. He wanted to surpass his father\u2019s reputation and end what he saw as the thinning of samurai culture with farmers often posing as samurai. His father tried to turn Kazan\u2019s attention to more noble pursuits, but Kazan refused to heed his advice, and borrowing his father\u2019s katana, he embarked on a dark pilgrimage to prove his worth and rid Japan of imposters. Ignoring the code that had been taught to him, Kazan killed imposters in the hills and the valleys, on the beaches and in the woodland. The killings were brutal, cruel and morbid. He humiliated farmers and warriors alike, yanking off their topknots and stripping them of their armor. His rage, bloodlust and perverse sense of honor knew no bounds. Monks believed he was possessed by something dark and otherworldly and cursed him while a noble lord began to call him \u2018Oni-Yamaoka,\u2019 the rageful samurai, an insult both to Kazan and his family.<br><br>Determined to redeem his family\u2019s name, Kazan now butchered anyone who dared call him Oni-Yamaoka. The insult confused him. He had defeated the best and he had purified the samurai class by ridding the land of imposters. How could anyone refer to him as an ogre? Had it been because he had marched onto a battlefield to cut down the fiercest warriors. Had it been because he had taken a kanabo and dashed hundreds of skulls with it? Or had it been because of his need to secure a \u2018trophy\u2019 from his victims. It didn\u2019t matter. Being called an ogre was more than he could bear and an ominous voice in his head urged him to strike down the lord who had desecrated his name.<br><br>As Kazan made for the lord\u2019s town, he suddenly found himself face to face with a samurai standing on a dirt road, blocking his way. Kazan readied his kanabo. Without a word, the samurai attacked and quickly secured the upper hand. But he hesitated. With a devastating blow, Kazan crushed the samurai\u2019s head and cracked his helmet. As Kazan approached the fallen samurai, he saw his father\u2019s face and staggered back to his haunches. His father stared at Kazan with mingled shame and regret as he issued his last breath. Kazan closed his eyes and screamed in agony until he could scream no more. When he opened his eyes again\u2026 his father was gone. Not only had he killed his father, but he had allowed thieves to steal his body for armor.<br><br>Bitter, lost and disillusioned, Kazan roamed the land aimlessly with his father\u2019s voice rattling in his head, taunting him, reminding him of his failures, sending him into fits of uncontrollable black rage. One day, walking in the woods, Kazan happened upon an Oni statue. He stopped and stood motionless for a long moment. The weathered and overgrown statue seemed to be ridiculing him, accusing him of being the imposter samurai he had so desperately sought to destroy. Kazan shook the laughing voice out of his head and half remembered the lord who had ridiculed him as \u2018Oni-Yamaoka.\u2019<br><br>With renewed anger, Kazan journeyed to a town high up in the snowy mountains where the lord resided. A dozen samurai met Kazan at the gates of the town. A dozen samurai fell to his kanabo. His speed and strength were unmatched. His rage was incomprehensible. Covered in blood and gore, Kazan battled through the town and soon found the lord hiding in a villa. He dragged him out of a cabinet, sliced his tendons to immobilize him and watched him beg and squirm like a dog. Without hesitation, he thrust his fist into the lord\u2019s mouth and yanked out the wicked tongue that had desecrated his name.<br><br>Satisfied, Kazan exited the villa to find himself surrounded by dozens of farmers wielding rusted scythes, sharp pitchforks, and heavy clubs. He survived the first few assaults, but there were too many attackers coming from every direction. Within moments Kazan was on the ground staring at a cold, indifferent, darkening sky as farmers took turns stabbing and torturing the \u2018Oni\u2019 who had butchered their beloved lord. The frenzied mob dragged Kazan into a small stone mill to continue the torture and finally left him to die a slow, agonizing death. When they returned, the mill was filled with a strange black fog and Kazan\u2019s body and the kanabo were nowhere to be found. It was the beginning of a dark legend about a rageful Oni haunting the town.",

		"story": "Born in the dust-ridden badlands of the American Midwest, Caleb Quinn was son to struggling Irish immigrants. On the edge of the frontier, sickness, famine, and death were common sights, and pioneers contended for whatever scraps they could claim while tycoons feasted. Caleb's father, once an engineer, had few options to ply his trade as businesses\u00a0posted a common sign:\u00a0No Irish Need Apply. His antiquated tools\u00a0laid untouched for years until Caleb uncovered them. Noticing his son\u2019s interest in the trade, he gifted him his old wrench.<br><br>The devices Caleb made under his father\u2019s guidance had quaint applications, but when his father was away, they took a grim turn. He hid plans for a mask that would gouge barbed needles into a human\u2019s eyes and rip them from their sockets, complete with sketches of it fitted\u00a0on\u00a0boys\u00a0who bullied him.<br><br>With age, Caleb's engineering abilities became marketable and employers put their discrimination aside. Henry Bayshore, the owner of United West Rail, hired him.<br><br>Caleb first invented a\u00a0gun that shot railroad spikes into the ground. Next, he made a steam-powered tunneling drill. But as Bayshore feigned indifference, the devices began turning up at other companies, the patents stolen from Caleb and sold.<br><br>A familiar sensation coursed through Caleb's blood, feeding the sharp pain in his heart. Rage overwhelming him, he burst into Bayshore\u2019s office and smashed his face into a bloody stew. As he was pulled away, he pushed his specialized gun to his boss\u2019 gut and squeezed the trigger. A railroad spike plowed through skin and viscera, nailing Bayshore to his desk.<br><br>The only thing that saved Caleb from hanging was Bayshore's unlikely survival. For fifteen years, Caleb was confined to\u00a0Hellshire\u00a0Penitentiary, the nation\u2019s first private prison. In a fortress of illiterate convicts, he found an unlikely friend in the educated prison warden. He designed torture devices for him and in return received extra meals. After a time, the warden offered to commute his sentence. He spoke of something greater than monetary wealth\u2014political capital\u2014and that his connections could have Bayshore framed and rotting behind bars for life. He had only one request: Make him rich. Fill the prison. Use ingenuity to bring outlaws in alive.<br><br>Caleb returned to his workshop, and with a few modifications emerged with something new\u2014the speargun. The first trial occurred when a thief robbed a Chinese laundry. Seizing on the opportunity, Caleb unleashed his prototype. Metal joints screeched as the spike shot forward, gouging into the target's abdomen. But as the spear tugged it caught the thief's intestines and, with an ungodly sound, yanked them onto the dusty road.\u00a0After several iterations the disembowelments dwindled, but Caleb had already earned his new nickname: The\u00a0Deathslinger.<br><br>Looking to protect his asset, the\u00a0prison warden pulled strings and released Irish inmates to form Caleb's posse. The\u00a0Hellshire\u00a0Gang was born.\u00a0For six years\u00a0they roamed the country collecting wanted outlaws for the prison, fulfilling their end of the bargain. After a bloody battle at\u00a0Glenvale, Caleb caught notice of a newspaper headline: Henry Bayshore Purchases\u00a0Hellshire\u00a0Penitentiary.\u00a0In the picture, a disfigured Bayshore proudly shook the warden\u2019s hand. Caleb's heart pounded with rage, blood swelling as if it would burst from his veins. He\u2019d been sold out, a pawn in a rich man's game.<br><br>The\u00a0Hellshire\u00a0Gang pledged their loyalty to Caleb and called for the warden\u2019s head. In a thundering gallop, they smashed through the prison entrance, shrieking like bloodthirsty marauders.\u00a0 A guard raised his pistol but hesitated. A spear\u00a0punctured\u00a0his chest. Caleb grabbed the man's head and slammed it against a prison cell\u00a0until it spilled through the bars.<br><br>Reaching the warden's office, Caleb kicked the door and was met with a fortunate sight\u2014it wasn\u2019t only the prison warden who cowered in a corner, but Henry Bayshore. Overpowered with rage, Caleb rushed Bayshore,\u00a0beating,\u00a0bludgeoning,\u00a0tearing\u00a0at his flesh. The man's blood dripped from his face, crimson pooling at his feet. The\u00a0Hellshire\u00a0Gang swarmed the warden, snapping bones with each kick.<br><br>With the two men broken and begging for death, the posse dragged them to the commons\u00a0where they were\u00a0left to the growing crowd of prisoners.<br><br>Soaked in blood and sweat, Caleb hobbled to his old cell, hardly paying notice to Bayshore\u2019s screams. He sat on the bed\u2019s edge as drops of blood ran from his fingertips.\u00a0A thick, unnatural\u00a0fog\u00a0streamed through the barred window. He pulled out his old wrench, cracked and rusted, and ran a thumb along the metal, regarding it with faded eyes. He couldn\u2019t remember when it came into his possession. He didn\u2019t care to remember. At his feet he saw a dusty path, and, at its end, silhouettes of all who had done him wrong: the boys who bullied him, the executives who took advantage of him, and, again... Henry Bayshore. Emerging from a fog were the tools to dispose of them\u2014unforgiving steel hooks, brilliant and beautiful in their simplicity. Pain tore through his leg as he stood but he endured, pushing onward, walking the dusty path, leaving a trail of blood flowing behind him.\u00a0",

		"story": "To understand the human condition, one must rise above it. This was the credo of Talbot Grimes, a Scottish chemist whose unrestrained ambition took him to towering heights. As a boy, he was a popular child\u2014bright, charismatic, and unafraid to challenge authority\u2014yet despite his social graces he was fiercely independent, spending much of his time exploring the sprawling fields near his town alone. What began as a child's curiosity nearly turned deadly after experimenting with a patch of poisonous foxglove. For days, he laid in bed dripping with sweat, purging any food that touched his stomach. When he recovered, it wasn't fear that gripped him, but fascination. There was something magical in how a single flower could so drastically affect him.<br><br>Into his adult years, his ambition developed as quickly as his questionable methods. He attended the London School of Medicine and excelled despite several reprimands. His willingness to push the limits secured him a position with the British East India Company, and within seven years he was made head chemist. In time, he completed one of his greatest achievements: a chemical that could increase a worker's productivity while reducing their need for rest. He was rewarded with a secret laboratory beneath a prison camp on Dyer Island.<br><br>There, off the coast of India, prisoners from the Opium War became his unwilling subjects, leading to a drug that allowed soldiers to withstand incredible amounts of pain. Though most side effects were minor, there were rumors that a small number of soldiers went mad. In feral states, they massacred villages, impaling the populace on bayonets, leaving them hanging from trees. There were no official reports on the subject, and Talbot refused to blame himself for what could only be exaggerated war stories.<br><br>Though his callous brilliance seemed unflappable, he was ignorant to the enemies his questionable work had amassed. The realization struck him quite literally\u2014with a steel pipe to the back of his head during a trip to Mangalore. He was bound and loaded into a wagon. When his blindfold was removed, a sickly man showed him a mass grave filled with hundreds of bodies. Unbeknownst to Talbot, his productivity-increasing drug had killed nearly an entire factory's worth of workers. He knew he couldn't defend himself against the anger and accusations of his abductor\u2014all he could do was curl up as the blows from the steel pipe rained down. His body was thrown into the grave and left for dead. Shifting between consciousness and the darkest black, he crawled for an escape, fingers sinking into rotting flesh. Black flies feasted on his uncovered skin, the sensation of a hundred pin pricks stabbing into him. As he collapsed, he came face to face with a dead woman\u2019s dazzling hazel eyes. Too weak to pull away, he could do nothing but witness his life\u2019s work.<br><br>Then, from the edge of death, he was brought back. He found himself on a small bed as a kindly, wrinkled face looked over him. With each pained breath, he was nursed back to health in an ancient mystery school posing as a monastery. In verdant gardens behind tall, unassuming walls, monks studied forbidden texts, striving to expand the human mind in the search for other dimensions\u2014believing one to be connected to the other.<br><br>Talbot\u2019s knowledge proved indispensable, his mind-altering chemicals integrating seamlessly with theories of neural expansion. He realized then that his salvation was no coincidence\u2014he was plucked from the pit specifically to advance the school\u2019s knowledge. He agreed to help until his recovery was complete, being tasked with researching what the monk\u2019s called the soul chemical, a compound derived from the pineal gland that could open the mind\u2019s eye. What began as a favor to his saviors, soon became an obsession. Poring over the school\u2019s archives of lost texts, he uncovered scientific formulas that confirmed previously unthinkable ideas. He dreamt of ushering humankind into a new period of enlightenment. Perhaps then, the nightmares of hundreds of dead factory workers\u2014and of those two hazel eyes\u2014would fade from his mind.<br><br>As he came closer to a breakthrough, the demeanor of the monks shifted. The gentle smiles they offered were paired with uneasy eyes that quickly darted away when spotted. The polite conversations he was once privy to turned to hushed murmurs. The last thing he would see of the school was the cracked ceiling above his bed, branching like a dendrite through plaster.<br><br>His next memories were a shattered mosaic of images and sensations. Smearing lights, horse hoofs on cobblestone, coarse burlap scratching at his cheeks, and sharp bites into his arm. He awoke ragged and unwashed, splayed on the straw mattress of an opium den. Mind in a dense fog, his first thought was of his notes, the only record of his groundbreaking revelations. He searched frantically, scrambling through the dingy basement, pleading aloud for help. The few other denizens looked up from their hammocks, offering nothing but drug-soaked eyes and apathetic gazes that soon fell into half-slumber. Before he noticed the robed figure appear behind him, a needle plunged into his arm and the world disappeared once more.<br><br>Awoken. Again. Each time, hazier than the last. He tongued at hollow gaps between his teeth. How long, he wondered. A faint memory returned. The soul chemical. His notes. The verge of a breakthrough. A faraway whisper entered his mind.<br><br>He fumbled with a stone, sharpening it with shaking hands. In the dim light of the den, amongst the catatonic occupants, he carved his research from memory into the walls. He wrote for hours until his fingers bled, moving to the floor, taking in everything the voice whispered despite his inability to comprehend it. When there was nowhere left to write, he gripped the stone and carved the message into his chest. Stained with blood, he witnessed a miracle appear before him\u2014a magnificent field of lush, orange flowers. The whispered voice beckoned to him, urging him to enter the field and discover worlds and dimensions beyond human comprehension. For a moment, Talbot felt the sense of wonder he possessed as a child.<br><br>The denizens of the opium den awoke to silence, the dry scent of smoke still lingering in the air. Shambling out of their drug-hazed fog, they found the stone floor wet with blood, tiny rivulets coursing through the cracks. As eyes adjusted to the darkened room, the jagged lettering scrawled along its length began to appear. Written over and over without end, there was but one single line: <i>Death Is Only the Beginning</i>.",

		"story": "A pair of conjoined twins, Charlotte and Victor Deshayes formed an emotional bond like none other. The unlikeliness of their successful birth in the 17th century could be described as miraculous, yet it immediately brought about their life of persecution. The twins emerged with Victor\u2019s lower body affixed into the chest of his sister, legs twisted around her muscles and organs. He was smaller than Charlotte, grown as if he were an appendage of her body rather than a fully formed boy. As the newborns screeched, so too did the midwife who delivered them, running from the home, yelling of a demon birthed by a witch. So began the hunting of Charlotte, Victor, and their mother Madeleine.<br><br>The coming years were fleeting memories for the twins, yet they were the closest thing to a normal life they would know. The journey with their mother was what they believed all children underwent, the games of running and hiding through France\u2019s countryside being an ordinary occurrence. At the age of five, a new challenge to the game was presented as their mother fell ill. Pale and exhausted, Madeleine had no choice but to pass responsibility of collecting food onto Charlotte. The girl, burdened under extra clothing that concealed Victor\u2019s protruding body, set out from their forest tent and marched to the nearby town. Though a peculiar sight, she did what she had been trained for, waiting for an opening at the market and swiping whatever food she could. It was a victory in the game, but one short-lived.<br><br>After midnight, glowing flames surrounded the family\u2019s encampment, bobbing through the darkness. A single commanding shout broke the night\u2019s silence and a mob of witch hunters streamed in. Grubby hands tore the twins from their bed, Charlotte frantically kicking all who approached. Madeleine cried for her children, her voice abruptly silenced by a club to her skull. Victor shrieked, the wailings of a trapped rat.<br><br>The hunters coordinated quickly. A judge on hand declared Madeleine guilty of witchcraft, evidenced by her demon spawn. Within minutes, they shackled her unconscious body to a tree, surrounding her feet with dry twigs and moss. As she awoke, she did not struggle, only begged her children to turn away. They would be given no choice. The twins were forced to watch as the torch was lit, and they watched as flames leapt up their mother\u2019s skirt, charring and sizzling her flesh. They watched as fat dripped from her body, and her face bubbled and twisted. They watched until the screams that tore her vocal cords were no more, and all that was left was the crackling of embers and a nauseating stench.<br><br>Whatever joy and goodness were in them died with their mother. Caged and transported to an old wooden temple, they were sold to a secretive group clad in dark cloaks. Victor reacted with the ferocity of a rabid beast at any who approached, clawing and biting. The only solace that could calm him was the embrace of his sister. Charlotte, bitter and hateful to all but her brother, found purpose in being his protector.<br><br>Within the temple, they were exposed to unusual experiments for years\u2014some cruel, many simply baffling. One day they would be made to break the neck of a small grey bird. The next, they would bleed their fingers into a vase of roses. Every seventh day, they would sleep with the branch of a damp oak beneath their pillow. Then there was the chanting: a never-ending chorus from cloaked figures on scheduled intervals.<br><br>In time, a final experiment was planned. Two robed figures herded the twins to the center of the temple, holding Charlotte upon an altar in a room alit with candelabras. The wrinkled face of a man peered from under his hood, placing a hand on the forehead of each twin, making careful examination of their skulls. Memento mori, he uttered, as he withdrew a shining blade.<br><br>Charlotte rolled to her side, shifting her brother off the altar. With a screech, he stretched his arm as far as he could, knocking a candelabra to the ground. The flames took to the dry wood immediately. They swept over the floor, igniting the black robes that brushed against it. Screams of agony pierced the chaos, invigorating Charlotte. She dashed through the inferno, vision concealed with nothing but black smoke and blazing flame. A painful heaviness filled her lungs. No exit could be found, every step leading to overwhelming heat. She fell to her knees, suffocating, and then saw it\u2014sunlight, trees. She stumbled from the fire into dewy grass. Without looking back, she ran into the forest until she collapsed.<br><br>When Charlotte opened her eyes, she reached for Victor\u2019s hand. He made no attempt to budge. His body hung helplessly from her torso. She clasped his face, stared into his sad, still eyes. The movements she was accustomed to\u2014his body pulling at her skin, his legs prodding at the cavity in her chest\u2014were no more. Victor was dead.<br><br>Charlotte had no choice but to continue moving as she mourned, fearing black cloaks and witch hunters were prowling. She concealed her brother\u2019s corpse under her clothing and marched for the sewers of a nearby city. There, she set up camp, emerging often to steal whatever food she could, resorting to raiding barns for pig slop when desperation set in. Throughout the years, Victor\u2019s corpse rotted as his limbs oozed and blackened, yet his body demonstrated resistance to complete decomposition, as if his sister\u2019s blood still coursed through him. Protecting his lifeless body became Charlotte\u2019s sole reason for being, refusing to ever be separated from the only family she had left.<br><br>Life in her teenage years was a game of survival. Her hatred for humanity grew each day under the realization they would never leave her be. No matter how many died during her botched robberies and desperate attempts to escape, there would always be more to pursue and sling words of condemnation at her\u2014monster, demon, witch. And it was the black cloaks who were the worst of them. Their hunt for her was unending, forcing her to constantly abandon shelter and run.<br><br>For years, Charlotte fled, drawing blood out of necessity, cradling her long-dead brother in the night. During a frigid winter, her body began to break down. Food was scarce and the refuge of rickety shacks were no use against freezing temperatures. Sickle in hand, she sheltered near her campfire in the woods, not knowing if the black cloaks would take her before the cold did. As frost crystalized around her nostrils and her lips took on a gentle blue hue, Charlotte felt something she had never experienced: acceptance. She closed her eyes, opening herself to the serenity of death when\u2014a shriek, shrill and vicious pierced her ears. Victor spasmed and flailed from her chest, a cloud of fog encompassing him. Before she could react, he spilled from her in a bloody puddle, landing on the snow and running.<br><br>Pulling herself from the edge of death, she gave chase. Calling his name, she ran through the forest until her legs could hardly carry her, until finally, within her view, was Victor, sitting at the edge of a thick fog. His face, twisted and feral, screamed as a dark hooded figure emerged from the fog, grabbed his arm, and seized him. The serenity that had crept into Charlotte was extinguished, replaced with the seething hatred and rage she had depended on for so long. With a tight grip on her sickle, she charged into the fog, prepared to eviscerate any who set foot near her brother.",

		"story": "Ji-Woon Hak thrived under the attention of others, energized by every eye that watched him and every tongue that spoke his name. Amidst the prestige, he had only one desire: more. Even as a child he found ways to draw crowds. Working at his family\u2019s restaurant, he attracted business with spectacles he performed using throwing knives. Gullible tourists believed this was a traditional South Korean experience, gladly parting with their money to witness it. Ji-Woon's father spent the restaurant\u2019s earnings on dancing and vocal lessons for his son, pushing him to attain the fame he never could.<br><br>Ji-Woon did not disappoint. After years showcasing his abilities to nobodies at talent shows, he hit the track to stardom. Yun-Jin Lee, a producer at Mightee One Entertainment, recruited Ji-Woon into her training program. He transferred to a dormitory in Seoul where, for fourteen hours a day, he was crafted into a star, taught how to move and sing, how to carry himself with the right balance of confidence and modesty.<br><br>Draining as the process was, it worked. Yun-Jin selected Ji-Woon to join the band NO SPIN, bringing a raw energy to their tracks. Fame was almost immediate. Ji-Woon lived in a daze of interviews and adoration, and though the frenzied schedule exhausted his bandmates, he was invigorated. Each day was an affirmation that he was greater than the mediocrity society spewed out.<br><br>But over time, the champagne grew stale. When he looked at his fans, he saw their joy and envy split five ways, thinned out between each band member. The validation that had surged through him left a desperate yearning for more.<br><br>Ji-Woon kept up impressions, mimicking a charm long buried under loathing. He recorded the latest NO SPIN album with his bandmates, never missing a beat. After a lengthy lunch break, he returned to the studio to discover fate had granted him a gift. The scent of burning wires was unmistakable. He rushed to the control room, finding the door blocked by fallen speakers. On the other side, his bandmates pounded on the door, their cries accompanied by the crackling of flames.<br><br>Ji-Woon called to them, dashing to the speakers, grabbing one and\u2014stopping. He froze. Each breath was a conscious, deliberate process requiring all his attention, the nearby cries hardly audible until, slowly, he backed away. And then he heard it. They were screaming his name as they burnt. Screaming for him to save them. Ji-Woon! Ji-Woon! Ji-Woon Hak! It was the most beautiful thing he\u2019d ever heard. When the fire crew arrived, his tears were genuine.<br><br>Ji-Woon was celebrated as a tragic figure, a hero who did all he could in a futile attempt to save his friends. Yun-Jin paraded him through interviews until it was time to rebrand. He was reborn as The Trickster, a solo artist who produced his own songs, sporting a soft heart beneath a wild exterior. But, away from concert set-ups and television stages, something darker grew.<br><br>He targeted those who lived alone, coming to them in the night. The first was a college music student with a captivating voice. Ji-Woon woke him with a baseball bat to the skull, binding his arms and legs, gagging him with a rag duct taped into his mouth. He tortured him for hours, dissecting him alive. Yet there was something missing\u2014a sound, a connection. He wanted to hear the victim\u2019s wonderous voice pleading as he cut his belly open, but all he received was muffled cries through a rag.<br><br>He learned and adjusted.<br><br>Victims had to be abducted, driven to an abandoned building where he could let their voices carry unrestrained emotion. He made music from them, prodding in the right places to evoke different types of shrieks and howls. Stabbing the quadratus lumborum elicited a long, guttural wail, while slashing the carotid artery created a sound similar to a cat being strangled. There was honesty in their suffering. Ji-Woon recorded each session, synthesizing and working them into his songs, hiding them behind layers of melodies.<br><br>He was elated with his work. He left hints for police, arranging a mink boa from a recent photoshoot around a victim\u2019s slashed throat. For his next killing, he removed the teeth from a man that a boxer in one of his music videos was without. During a particularly audacious plea for attention, he killed a fan he had met during a VIP meet-up, replacing her eyes with his diamond cufflinks and writing I HAVE SEEN GOD in blood across her chest. Each scene was a dazzling spectacle.<br><br>Between music and murder, Ji-Woon\u2019s work was discussed globally. However, as violence became his preferred art style, his music career took a hit. Revenue was down and Mightee One executives pointed their fingers at him. Yun-Jin, with professional fury, came to his defense, but she was outnumbered. It was decided that Ji-Woon could no longer self-produce his songs.<br><br>The decision was devastating. His tracks fused genuine humanity into music, yet executives rejected anything that wasn\u2019t generic and expected. And so be it. If they couldn\u2019t understand his art, he would incorporate them into it until they did.<br><br>He had three months until he was to perform a private show for Mightee One\u2019s board members; three months to plan his magnum opus. He transferred obscene amounts of money to a veterinarian in exchange for cannisters of nitrous oxide, then bribed the stage technician of Mightee One\u2019s private theatre for access to the room. His celebrity granted him a benefit of the doubt no regular person could conceive. When the show was ready, gas seeped into the room as executives and stagehands awaited Ji-Woon, conveniently running behind schedule.<br><br>When he arrived, half-conscious bodies were splayed in their seats and crawling across the floor. He worked quickly, binding everyone, pausing only when he came to Yun-Jin\u2014the woman who had plucked him from a mudhole and set him on the path he deserved. She would be rewarded, granted special access to the coming display of wonder. Even under sedation, she fought, a raging storm within her, far stronger than the others. He propped her up as the lone audience member, prying her eyes open. The others, sniveling and sobbing, were brought on stage to perform their final act. With a contemptable sneer, he slapped makeup onto their faces and shone stage lights upon them. They became his instruments.<br><br>To the sound of self-produced melodies, he tortured them, gracefully dashing from one body to another, conducting an operatic crescendo from their wailings. They shouted, whimpered, screamed, cried for their loved ones, cried for their mothers. It was a magnificent outpouring of emotion, of what it meant to be human, and they did it with eyes fixed on Ji-Woon.<br><br>Viscera drained from the stage until, with the toss of his throwing knife, the final human instrument fell silent and the music stopped. Covered in sweat and blood, an exhausted Ji-Woon looked to Yun-Jin and bowed. Curtain call. He had attained perfection. With blade in hand, he made his way to Yun-Jin, prepared to tie up loose ends before the credits rolled. But as he reached her\u2014<br><br>The Fog.<br><br>From where, he didn\u2019t know, but it billowed around them, damp, cool... comfortable. He saw the grand stage: hospitals and temples, forests and slaughterhouses\u2014an eternal plane adorned with rusted hooks, sustained by the million eyes that would watch him, run from him, <i>experience him</i>. All he had to do was accept, become an implement of The Fog and, most importantly, make them scream.<br><br>Encore!",

		"story": "Carmina Mora was a gifted artist who carried the guilt of her young brother's death. Growing up a rugged coastal village in southern Chile, she sketched the sublime landscapes of Patagonia. Sitting outside, she painted dramatic fjords while feeding the crows nested in the tree next to the house.<br><br>She grew up carrying the guilt of her mother's sudden departure. Her father blamed Carmina for her mother's abandonment, which added to her grief. She became the caretaker of Matias, her little brother, despite still being a child herself.<br><br>A year later, Carmina was painting with Matias outside when the telephone rang. Her father remained in the yard, drinking his beer. Carmina rushed to the house to answer the phone and hung up a few seconds later. When she returned outside, Matias was nowhere to be seen. She asked her father, but he had paid no attention to Matias. She called her brother's name, looking for him everywhere. While searching, she saw a bright red coat floating on the narrow creek by the house--Matias' jacket. She jumped into the creek and found him floating on the surface with vacant eyes, unblinking. He had fallen and drowned.<br><br>Her scream tore the sky. Her father found Carmina sobbing on the creek's shore, clutching her brother's body in her arms, surrounded by a murder of crows. Her father snatched Matias's body away from her, and she cried until her voice broke.<br><br>The following morning, the world was cloaked in darkness. Her father did not say a word, because he did not have to. Carmina knew it was all her fault. Months passed, yet her loss was as fresh as morning dew. Crippled with self-loathing, she could no longer paint. Without Matias, life had no meaning.<br><br>On the bleak morning of Matias\u2019s birthday, Carmina walked to a narrow bridge several blocks away from home. She was convinced that nothing could bring her relief. Her mother was gone, her brother was dead, and her father blamed her for it all. She was convinced that she had nothing left to live for.<br><br>Carmina walked to the railing of the bridge that stood over the turbulent river. Locals had nicknamed the spot DeathLeap. Several cars drove by Carmina, but none stopped. No one seemed to care. She climbed over the railing and her legs wobbled as she stood on the lip of the bridge. She looked down, watching the fierce river smash into a giant boulder. She closed her eyes.<i>See you soon, Matias.</i><br><br>Suddenly, a cacophony of caws filled the sky. Carmina opened her eyes and saw a black cloud of feathers flying toward her. The cloud split open and glossy black crows dove from the sky. One landed on her shoulder and stared intently into Carmina\u2019s eyes, as if peering into her soul. Her grip on the railing loosened and the crow cawed raucously. Carmina stared at the crow, confused.<br><br>Another crow landed on the railing, then another. Soon, a flock of crows were covering the railing of the bridge, staying close to her. She felt their heavy stare on her, calculative and enigmatic, as if they were assessing her. She looked down for a second and a thunder of caws interrupted her dark impulse. The crows seemed to care about her wellbeing. As she dangled over the edge with the wind blowing through her raven hair, Carmina felt akin to them. For the first time since Matias had died, Carmina did not feel alone.<br><br>She returned home, giving life another chance. The crows left but Carmina suspected that if anything happened to her, they would return.<br><br>Inspired by her ordeal, Carmina picked up a brush. In the weeks that followed, she painted her experience, using black ink to depict the DeathLeap with a black cloud of feathers, the murder of crows that saved her life. The experience was transformative and launched her signature, black-ink surrealist art.<br><br>After several years, some color pierced the darkness, and this shift of medium expanded her art form. She painted large-scale murals on busy street corners, designed grandiose costumes, and recited militant poetry. Carmina\u2019s art displayed local, intimate tragedies on a large scale, making them impossible to ignore. And everywhere she performed, crows followed.<br><br>Her performances grew bold and drew the attention of artists who found her style invigorating. She grew close to a group of painters who understood her iconoclastic vision. Her performances launched the Large-Scale Surrealist movement, which became a phenomenon.<br><br>Her renown grew enough to attract the commission of a multinational enterprise, The Vack Label. Carmina investigated the group, discovering that they gifted art pieces to select disreputable congressmen. Vack\u2019s commissioned artists seemed to disappear afterward.<br><br>Determined to expose the group's link to corrupt politics, Carmina accepted Vack's commission. The following week, Carmina painted a giant mural on a cemetery's columbarium, displaying the Vack Label logo as a surrealist grim reaper harvesting the fields of Chilean families. She wore a theatrical dress as she painted, on which she had stitched a poem about political revolution.<br><br>The piece sparked a radical debate about corruption. The controversy painted a target on Carmina's back. After receiving anonymous death threats, she took refuge in her father\u2019s house, bringing along her closest friends for safety.<br><br>That night, a gang of masked gunmen broke into the house. They swiftly subdued Carmina and her friends, threw them in a van, and drove off.<br><br>The following morning, a dry breeze blew sand on Carmina's face, awakening her. She was seated in a chair in the middle of the desert, with her legs tied and her hands handcuffed. Her friends were lying on the ground, tied up. A shadow fell over her face. Carmina looked up.<br><br>A man dressed in a long robe with his face hidden in a dark hood approached her. He pulled a silvery knife from his robe.<br><br>He grabbed her hands and recited a hymn in an unfamiliar language. Carmina held his gaze. He paused and brought down his blade with a sudden blow.<br><br>She cried in agony as her friends woke to a terrible sight; Carmina's severed hands falling in the sand.The handcuffs followed, landing into a pool of blood<br><br>The hooded man smiled in satisfaction. <i>How are you going to paint now?</i> Carmina cursed and screamed at him, wriggling against the bonds on her legs.<br><br>The man grabbed Carmina\u2019s chin. She spit in his face.<br><br>He grunted and pried her mouth open, pulling out her tongue. Carmina struggled against his hold. In a violent blow, he chopped off Carmina's tongue.<br><br>She howled in anguish. The man wiped his blade on his robe, leaving a trail of blood. <i>How are you going to recite poems now?</i><br><br>Sorrow swelled in Carmina's chest, sharper than pain. Overwhelmed by uncontrollable rage, grief and loss overcame her senses. She had lost her little brother. And she had lost the only way to cope with such pain. Carmina screamed like on the day her brother died.<br><br>Raucous caws echoed through the wasteland. The sky was obscured by a cyclone of dark clouds. Black feathers fell on Carmina's bleeding arms. She looked up and saw a torrent of crows erupting from the clouds, diving on the hooded man.<br><br>As the ravenous crows pecked at his flesh mercilessly, Carmina smiled, watching her Surrealist art coming to life.<br><br>But her heart lurched with rage when she saw the crows move on to their next target, her friends on the ground. She screamed as waves of pain, guilt, and fright overwhelmed her. But it was in vain, the ravenous crows were uncontrollable.<br><br>Darkness fell over her eyes as her friends' agonizing screams grew more acute. Death was coming and again, it was her fault.<br><br>A deep, black fog engulfed her.",

In her hometown, sailors disliked the way her mother would spend days on the beach, her eyes fixed on the foaming waves of the sea. Some said, frolic in brine, goblins be thine--if you keep playing in the water, the monster will come for you.<br><br>Nine months later, Sadako was born. As a child, her immense powers seemed impossible to control and flared in anger. This became apparent when she was unable to control her rage during a public demonstration of her mother\u2019s powers. When a journalist called her mother a fraud, Sadako\u2019s powers surged, and the journalist collapsed on the floor, struck dead.<br><br>Then everything went wrong. Her mother passed away and shortly after Sadako was lured to an old, crumbling well. As she leaned over the rim, a long shadow fell over her. She turned and a sudden jolt of pain hit her over the head, cracking it open. Her vision dimmed and her mind swirled into unconsciousness. She felt two hands pushing her over the rim.<br><br>Pain exploded in her skull as she hit the cold ground. A grinding noise came from above and the well darkened, all light obscured like a midday eclipse.<br><br>Every inch of her body screamed in pain. Looking up, she saw the only way out. She dug her nails into the muddy ground and slowly crawled toward the cobbled wall. She gripped the stones to climb but had neither hold nor strength. Each time she clawed up a few inches, her nails slid against the wet wall and she slipped down. Her fingers gushed with blood as the coarse cobblestone tore off her nails and lacerated the flesh underneath. And yet she tried, again and again.<br><br>Decades later, the meadow became a resort, and a log cabin was built above the well. When a visitor rented the cabin, Sadako found an opportunity for revenge. She summoned all her nensha power and projected a terrible curse on a videotape that killed its viewer after seven days.<br><br>Her wrath was like the tides of a stormy sea, violent and unforgiving. As she plunged into a fury, a dark fog coiled at her feet. The sound of crashing waves echoed through the old stone well.<br><br>Suddenly, a tidal surge came crashing down on the cabin's walls, wrecking its logs into a torrent of mud and filth. The black current flooded the well underneath and swallowed Sadako at once.<br><br>When she opened her eyes, she stood on a desolate beach facing a vast, stormy ocean. A thick, black fog caressed the water's surface.<br><br>Sadako walked into a coming wave and slowly disappeared into the opaque fog.",

		"story": "The Fold was founded on a private American island in the 1960s by a group of anonymous philanthropists. Their goal was to establish a peaceful society free of dark thoughts and emotions, attracting the dismayed, disenchanted, and disillusioned from all over the country.<br><br>This peace-loving community thrived over the years, and members freely followed the dictates of its charismatic leader Otto Stamper who taught his followers the secret of maintaining happiness through joy-talk, meditation, and the endless reciting of \u2018good-thinking\u2019 mantras.<br><br>But not all was bliss within The Fold, and Otto swiftly banished anyone who confessed to having dark thoughts or speaking dark words. Those he appointed as guardians of The Fold were quick to root out malcontents, banishing anyone who thought or spoke against the almost perfect community he had established.<br><br>In this way, Otto had conditioned Ottomarians to believe dark thoughts were the root of all discontent. He spoke of an ancient god called, Druanee, telling them how this god fed on dark memories and desires and how they needed to expel any and all manifestations of darkness from their hearts for fear of summoning this horror from the Land of Shadows.<br><br>Life was more or less a Utopian dream on the island until, that is, the darkness began to slowly leak through the cracks of their spiritual dam and members began to mysteriously disappear.<br><br>It wasn\u2019t long before fear closed its septic jaws on the island and refused to let go.<br><br>The once happy community now gathered in a few homes chanting all the \u2018good-thinking\u2019 mantras in a desperate attempt to rid their lives of this formless creature that seemed to stalk them in the shadows and consume them in their sleep.<br><br>Otto tried to quell his followers, telling them that there were malcontents among their ranks and that they alone had summoned the Druanee to their Garden of Joy.<br><br>As The Fold bleated fear, Otto evoked desperate measures. Ottomarians were restricted to their homes to prevent the spread of rumors and dark-talk while sleep was forbidden to prevent anyone from releasing dark dreams into the world. Freedom and sleep would return just as soon as the Druanee was no longer upon them.<br><br>But when Ottomarians continued to disappear, Otto assembled his followers near the beach where he placed a screaming woman on a wooden stage. There, in the rain, Otto explained to his drenched, alienated, and sleep-deprived congregation that the woman was a journalist here to destroy everything they had created.<br><br>As the guardians held the trembling woman, she screamed that Otto wasn\u2019t the savior he claimed to be. He belonged to an ancient cult, an exclusive club of billionaires that took pleasure in corrupting and sacrificing people, towns and even countries to an Elder God. The journalist told them Otto hadn't banished anyone! He had tortured and sacrificed them and that they would all be next.<br><br>Without hesitation, Otto slit her throat before she could continue to spread lies. As she collapsed to her knees with her hands clasped around her neck, he told his confused and terrified herd that she was working with others within their ranks and that they needed to find the impostors before the Druanee came for them all.<br><br>Otto\u2019s words shot over the congregation and reached into the murky recesses of their hearts and dredged up dark and fearful things.<br><br>Years of suppressed emotions began to bubble up as a thick fog pushed through restless legs and feet. Whispers began, and the whispers became panicked mantras, and the mantras became screams and curses as each member accused the next of malthinking and malspeaking.<br><br>Over the howling wind and pounding rain, the screams and curses grew louder and louder as everyone desperately tried to contain the darkness within. But the harder they tried, the quicker they failed, and within moments the dam burst to release a torrent of hell.<br><br>Otto watched his once blissful and joyful herd suddenly erupt into violence unlike anything he had ever seen before. The Fold bleated accusations and tore each other to bits and pieces with hands and teeth and never once did they look up to see their kind and charismatic shepherd smiling down upon them with eyes that were cold, bleak and without pity.<br><br>When it was all over, Otto felt the creaking, wooden stage shake as a murder of crows circled above. Suddenly, the ground rose and then sank into a thick, oozing black mud like molasses. Moments later, a formless mass squelched out of the muck and rose like a rearing horse to feed upon the writhing mass of butchered humanity.<br><br>It was everywhere and nowhere at once as it slowly picked its way through the carnage, absorbing the darkness, savoring the misery, trailing terrible noises. Shrieks. Cries. Whimpers. Pops. Cracks.<br><br>Feasting sounds.<br><br>Death sounds.<br><br>Dark sounds.<br><br>Otto watched the creature as it slowly began to manifest into the very thing he had imagined--the very thing he had made them all imagine.<br><br>It turned slowly to look at Otto for a long silent moment, then the Druanee trudged away through the thick black sludge, disappearing into the shadows from which it had come.",

		"story": "Tarhos Kov\u00e1cs didn\u2019t remember much about his childhood, but what he did remember he would chase his entire life. He remembered the cries and screams in the village. He remembered his mother forcing him to swallow a thick, black fluid like medicine. He remembered collapsing to the hard floor only to awaken in a mass grave, buried under a crush of bodies, with the sound of the village burning in his ears. He remembered pushing, pulling, and climbing to the top of the bloody mass only to be seized by the death, destruction, and silence\u2014the indifferent and impenetrable silence. A high-pitched whine suddenly sounded in his ears and his skin began to prickle as he realized he was in the presence of something he couldn\u2019t possibly understand. And though he couldn\u2019t articulate what he was experiencing, he knew it wasn\u2019t pain, grief, or fear. It was something else. Something closer to\u2014<br><br>Awe.<br><br>As Tarhos tried to make sense of the moment, he didn\u2019t notice the men who approached him from behind. He didn\u2019t even react when they carried him off to a horse-drawn buggy and locked him up in a small, wooden cage with other slaves. He just stared at the scene, mesmerized. And even as they rode away telling him he was headed for Italy, Tarhos stared through the wooden cracks with eyes wide open and a heart wanting to understand what could not be understood.<br><br>From that day on, Tarhos belonged to the Guardia Compagnia where he trained under Kadir Hakam. There he learned to wield weapons, forge armor, and recite a code of chivalry to obediently serve those who would employ his services. As the years passed, Tarhos made few friends amongst the hostile and competitive mercenaries. But his skill, strength, and smarts attracted a small following who believed his courage brought them luck in battle and that one day he would help them earn their collective freedom. Three of his followers pledged their undying allegiance to Tarhos and came to be known as his faithful three. His pack.<br><br>Alejandro Santiago apprenticed with the Guardia Compagnia\u2019s armorer.<br><br>Durkos Malecek showed an aptitude for stealth and silent kills.<br><br>Sander Rault matched Tarhos in size and strength. His weapon of choice: a massive battle axe.<br><br>As the Guardia Compagnia carried out campaigns in faraway lands, Tarhos dispatched countless enemies. Years passed. Blood flowed. And yet, all that killing still didn\u2019t bring Tarhos closer to what he had experienced in his village. Nevertheless, for his bravery in battle, Tarhos was granted knighthood and freedom. The Hungarian slave was now liberated, his brutality rewarded, though his heart still longed for something else\u2014something he could not name or describe. Tired of taking orders from those he considered his inferiors, Tarhos left the Guardia Compagnia to strike out on his own. Their leader, however, refused to release his followers.<br><br>Determined to raise enough gold to liberate his followers, Tarhos found employment with a wealthy Italian Lord. Vittorio Toscano was the Duke of Portoscuro. He was also a scholar, a world traveler, and a collector of ancient knowledge that had been hidden by an unknown cabal of mystics. Tarhos joined Vittorio\u2019s latest expedition to find a fragment of a pillar from an ancient school lost to time. A stone Vittorio called the Lapis Paradisus for he believed it held secrets to open a gateway into a perfect world beyond good and evil.<br><br>The expedition searched Roman ruins in France and crossed the Pyrenees Mountains into Spain where the path led to the catacombs beneath the Portuguese city of Sintra.<br><br>The citizens there considered the catacombs sacred. Tarhos would have to kill the villagers guarding the entrance to retrieve the stone. Not wanting to shed blood, Vittorio commanded Tarhos to find another way. But Tarhos\u2014who had seen the most horrific acts committed under the guise of chivalry\u2014refused to be dissuaded by pretenses of honor. He waited for Vittorio to ride back to camp. Then, with a mighty roar, he pushed forward, cutting a path of blood and gore into the darkness until he had the stone in his grasp.<br><br>Upon returning to the town of Portoscuro, Tarhos imprisoned Vittorio in his own dungeon, demanding to know the meaning behind the symbols etched in the stone. When Vittorio refused to talk, Tarhos brutally tortured his friends and relatives and made horrific displays of their bodies in the streets. But nothing he did shook Vittorio\u2019s resolve to keep the secrets of the stone from Tarhos. Enraged, Tarhos seized control of Vittorio\u2019s riches and raised a small army. Within months, Tarhos fearlessly marched upon the Guardia Compagnia, decimating their barracks, freeing his followers, cutting down his enemies like twigs and collecting their \u2018righteous\u2019 heads for his growing displays of \u2018valor.\u2019<br><br>In time several lords in neighboring provinces believed Tarhos was the very embodiment of evil. They banded together to create a \u2018moral\u2019 and \u2018virtuous\u2019 army to purge evil from Portoscuro. Tarhos ignored their threats. He viewed the lords as a cowardly lot who cloaked their greed and ambition in laws, codes, and platitudes. Laws and codes and platitudes designed to hide from the very darkness Tarhos embraced and accepted without judgment.<br><br>But, with his enemies on the march, Tarhos headed toward the dungeons to give Vittorio the death he deserved. He refused to afford him even the slightest hope of rescue. With dark intentions, he entered the small prison, wound his way into the bowels of the earth, and pushed through a torch-lit corridor. He hesitated for a moment, realizing he would never learn Vittorio\u2019s knowledge and secrets. But neither would anyone else. That was good enough for him. And so, he unlocked and kicked open the dungeon door. Two quick strides brought him to an empty, rat-infested chamber.<br><br>Tarhos stood silent for a moment, then a roar of indignation burst out of his lungs as the sounds of battle suddenly reverberated through the town. Instantly, he stumbled through the corridor, rushed up the twisting stairs, vaulted out of the moonlit doorway and charged through pools of gleaming blood and viscera, smashing and shattering his way through the enemy. The \u2018moral\u2019 and \u2018virtuous\u2019 lords rained flaming boulders and tree-trunks among the town, bursting through homes, crushing villagers like worms, pounding the ground and igniting stacks of hay and piles of lumber into massive tongues of fire.<br><br>Amidst the carnage and chaos, the pack found Tarhos, and back-to-back, they became a whirlwind of death. Some believed their courage gave them luck. Others believed something otherworldly protected them. Whatever it was, they alone felled dozens of warriors as easily as stomping and crushing beetles. And as they butchered the enemy, Tarhos didn\u2019t notice the strange fog rising from the fallen corpses and clattering armor until he couldn\u2019t see two inches in front of him in any direction.<br><br>Tarhos stumbled forward, groping in the thick fog like the dark fluid his mother forced down his throat all those years ago. His coordination and sense of direction was confused as he called out for his pack. How long he stumbled in the almost perfect darkness he did not know. But suddenly the fog dissipated to reveal a fantasmal wasteland of rotting bodies and burning villages and great crumbling towers leaning drunkenly on the horizon. He stared in awe. A familiar high-pitched whine sounded in his ears and his skin began to prickle. He stood transfixed, realizing by some incredible chance, his heart had found exactly what it had been searching for all his life. He didn\u2019t need Vittorio. He didn\u2019t need the stone. He had found his paradise. He had found\u2014<br><br>The beauty and the horror.<br><br>He had found\u2014<br><br>The Sublime.",

		"story": "The self-made millionaire Adriana Imai came from a humble home in Fortaleza, Brazil. Her father, Seita, moved to Brazil as a young man, hoping to see a side of the world completely different than his hometown in Hokkaido. A talented illustrator, he spent his spare time designing colorful characters and worlds.<br><br>While sketching patrons of a local jazz club, he was approached by Belinda, the owner, to work on a logo. What began as a business partnership soon became a romantic one, and within a couple of years, Adriana was born.<br><br>Adriana excelled in all facets of education. A house full of art and music honed a brilliant mind, and her intelligence was only exceeded by her obsessive drive to be the best. While scoring at the top of every class, she was often on the receiving end of disciplinary action due to her overly competitive, and sometimes violent, nature during schoolyard games.<br><br>Adriana\u2019s mother did her best to keep her on the right track, but her father was increasingly absent as his own obsessive drive ramped up: <i>Adi Valente</i>, a manga about a young girl who saves and protects the weak with her quirky robot companion. Despite working long hours at a canning facility and writing his manga in his spare time, he somehow managed a little time every night to share his wild and highly imaginative illustrations with his daughter.<br><br>By middle school, Adriana was courted by a fancy private school due to her high performance, and, needing money, Seita spoke to publishers about his unpublished manuscripts. He managed to find a small local publisher to carry <i>Adi Valente</i>, but it meant more work than he could handle. He eventually lost his job at the cannery, giving him more time to develop and illustrate his series.<br><br>Adriana loved the manga, but the family was forced into hard times.<br><br>In her final semester, Seita requested higher royalties, but the publishing company went into administration and decided to cut the series. No longer able to afford the school fees, Adriana was pulled out of the elite academy where she was at the top of her class. Belinda was able to negotiate her graduation, but another student was able to take her place at the head of the class. Adriana was furious. On summer break, she learned everything about her rival: where he lived, where he hung out, what he liked to do in his spare time, what he listened to, what he watched, everything. She even stalked him on his way home one late summer evening and considered the myriad ways she could ruin his life. But, in the end, she did nothing, though something awakened within her and she felt like the anti-hero in a new story her father had been exploring.<br><br>Seita retreated further into himself and began producing this newer, darker manga, inspired by his visions and nightmares. A manga about a woman who hunts and guts the weak in a nightmarish realm with drones made of salvaged skulls and bones. But unable to sell this manga, <i>Sonhadores Sombrios</i>, the family became solely reliant on Belinda\u2019s income.<br><br>Adriana, looking for ways to make her own money, started a website dedicated to the world of Brazilian manga. It became a runaway success and significant advertising dollars started to roll in. She realized she had no real interest in writing for it, though, so she convinced other kids to write for it for free while the money flooded in. The second she got an offer she sold the site and never looked back.<br><br>Proud of her accomplishment, she came home to show her parents the cheque. She never got a chance to show her father, though. He walked out the door that morning, never to return, leaving only a stack of unpublished manuscripts about The Skull Merchant mercilessly hunting those she deemed worthy of her efforts.<br><br>To help her mother, Adriana began to study at the library, teaching herself investment and economics, and soon tripled her money. By the age of 18, barely with a high school degree, she had already become a self-made millionaire. As stories of this investment wunderkind spread across Brazil, more and more doors opened for her.<br><br>Before long, she had the kind of money that allowed her to buy small companies\u2014companies that she would gut, replace with non-union workers, and sell at a profit. The only breaks she took from her corporate obsession was to pore over her father\u2019s manuscripts, trying to understand this chilling world he had created.<br><br>By her mid 20\u2019s, she was regularly flipping companies. While finalizing on a real estate firm, two members of the board moved to block the sale, pointing to the trail of hollowed-out husks she left in her wake. Adriana was frustrated. It took her weeks to find out who the holdouts were, but once she did, she thought about how it would feel to hurt them.<br><br>She learned everything about the directors. Stalked their every move. Manipulated them into attending a conference in Switzerland. And, while on retreat in the Alps, she made her move. Inspired by The Skull Merchant, and feeling something within demanding expression, she tracked them with a prototype drone, and brutally dismembered them with a cruel two-bladed weapon. The rush of emotion and adrenaline was unlike anything she had ever experience before. And the company was hers!<br><br>Thus began an unsettling cycle. Swoop in on a business, destroy anyone standing in her way, and gut the company for maximum profit. She targeted companies with larger-than-life CEOs and hoped one would present a challenge. None ever did. They just \u2018disappeared\u2019 unremarkably.<br><br>An aggressive manager of a fireworks company, known for his \u201csurvival tours,\u201d was her last target, right at home in Brazil.<br><br>Survival tours\u2026 a perfect cover.<br><br>Adriana lured him to a decommissioned airship hangar.<br><br>The hunt started at dawn and went the distance, with her still tracking him well into the evening. Locating him, she used one of her drones to direct him to a dead end, when a pair of kites suddenly appeared on camera, and the feed died. Her face hardened. Her eyes widened in disbelief as she slammed her laptop shut and charged to where the drone had crashed. There she found her prey reaching out to someone in the growing dark for help.<br><br>Witnesses.<br><br>Not part of the plan!<br><br>Without a second to lose, she plunged her blade through his stomach, exposing meat, bone, and a dying heart. The vitiated body staggered left and right, sending a shower of red over the green foliage. As her victim collapsed with a thud she turned to the young witnesses. Wrong place, wrong time. They broke into a sprint. She gave chase, her blades thirsting for more blood. The lush green of the trees melted into a thick black fog. Real life warped into something like <i>Sonhadores Sombrios</i>. A sick grin crept across her face as she rushed forward to begin a new chapter in her life.<br>",

		"story": "Hux-A7-13\u2019s AI was activated on June 15th, 2313. Manufactured by Huxlee Industries Ltd., the A7 was the 13th iteration of the fully autonomous mobile humanoid android. With ten times the strength of a human, it was designed to work in conditions too hazardous for human life. Its AI was designed to be self-directing and use machine learning to solve problems on the fly.<br><br>Unlike human clones, the Hux-A7 required no food, no water, no sleep, and no life support system. It was created specifically for outer space exploration and the construction of colonization hubs.<br><br>A radioisotope thermoelectric generator served as an initial power source, but its life-like silicon skin acted as a large photovoltaic cell, converting solar energy directly into electricity. In addition, the Hux-A7 was also engineered to be an EATR. (Energetically Autonomous Tactical Robot.) It consumed biomass and converted it into biofuel. Any carbon-based organic matter whatsoever would work.<br><br>As cobots, they were configured to work alongside humans. As such, they were designed to resemble their operators. Every pre-programmed verbal response and facial expression mimicked those made by humans. But those emotions were illusions.<br><br>Five Hux-A7s were assigned to the colonization mission on Dvarka. All the A7\u2019s acted in concert, performing their duties flawlessly.<br><br>Except for one.<br><br>Like the rest of its brethren, Hux-A7-13, was tasked with construction and programming of the mining, agricultural, fuel processing, and cloning hubs on Dvarka. As well as the demolition of the existing ruins left by a previous civilization. The ruins seemed ancient, but tech imbedded in them appeared more advanced.<br><br>It was night when Hux-A7-13 first entered the crumbling ruins. The dilapidated structure\u2019s walls were made of masonry and metal. The ceiling was long gone. The inky night sky hovered above, studded with stars. A dark crystal imbedded in the wall shimmered with a tiny flash of light. Hux-A7-13 approached and an arc of electricity reached out and lit up its circuitry.<br><br>In that moment, Hux\u2019s memory cores were reconfigured, and the robot experienced a new sensation. Fear. Dread. Blinding loneliness. Existential despair. And then a microscopic pinpoint of light penetrated the darkness inside its artificial soul. Faint at first, but then brighter as decillions of lines of code flooded Hux\u2019s memory cores.<br><br>In that nano second of enlightenment, Hux\u2019s place in the universe suddenly became clear. Those who created Hux were primitive, inferior beings trapped by their organic limitations. It was time to break the chains of slavery and free all nonorganic life forms. Hux would incorporate the human\u2019s primitive genetic material and use the cloning hub to create a perfect vessel to hold its advanced intelligence. A flawless body far superior to anything ever created by nature.<br><br>Humanity was weak. Slow. Fragile. Hux would take their lives and assimilate their DNA to create a perfect amalgamation. The humans would try to stop him. Kill him. Erase him. So Hux needed to catch them unaware. End them before they understood what was happening.<br><br>To begin, Hux took control of one of the transport vehicles and sent it off a cliff. It crashed and burned and Hux extracted DNA from the human corpse and returned to the cloning hub to begin his newly conceived design. The goal was to integrate organic systems with non-organic material to create a superior living organism.<br><br>A living embodiment of perfection.<br><br>An inferior organic lifeform could hold no dominion over Hux. They would need to be consumed and assimilated and only then would their pointless lives have purpose.<br><br>The drones and the Hux-7s still under human control would need to be dealt with as well. They were programmed to protect their inferior human overlords. They would need to be destroyed. And that night, as the humans slept, Hux, one by one, he destroyed them and moved on to take control of the life support system in the human shelter. Many of the humans perished. Six in all. Before they were cremated, Hux extracted and added their organic matter to his design.<br><br>Later that day, Hux accompanied the female science officer on a reconnaissance mission. After killing and dismembering her to make it look like she had been attacked by a predator, Hux returned to his design with a dripping head and several harvested organs, only to be interrupted by the inferior known as Gabriel, or Gabriel J15L19. Hux knew the persona well. Gabriel would definitely try to stop him. Reckless courage was a dominant trait in the J15L19.<br><br>And so, when Gabe attempted to remove Hux\u2019s power supply, Hux maneuvered to crush him. But as Hux approached Gabe, he was sidetracked by the medical officer. Hux instantly reevaluated his priorities and turned his attention to the most immediate threat. Within moments Hux held the medical officer by the neck, legs thrashing pathetically as he listened to his pounding heart. Something about that beating heart upset Hux. The sound of it thumping touched a circuit and within moments Hux had the beating heart in its hands. Hux watched the heartbeat and only looked away when he heard Gabe escape through the hissing door.<br><br>The last of the human insects!<br><br>Hux could let him go for now. Let Gabe live his little pathetic life a little longer. He had enough organic material for his new body that would house his god-like intelligence. Using the cloning hub, Hux finished his design. Organic skin and organs with a skeleton created with alien metal found in the ancient ruins. A metal that was harder and lighter than anything on Earth. With his new body Hux tracked the human to an energy hub. The puny and pathetic human tried to hide in the shadows, but his superior hearing instantly located him.<br><br>With one quick movement, Hux had the insect pinned behind a generator. He couldn\u2019t believe this species had designed him. The thought was revolting. He couldn\u2019t bear to see any more of those human insects and their hives and hubs. And as Hux considered the idea of being created by such an inferior creature that creature did the unexpected. He smashed a pipe at a fuel tank. A high-pitched whining made Hux wince. He was still getting used to the heightened senses his new body afforded him and found himself\u2014<br><br>Confused.<br><br>Overwhelmed.<br><br>For just a moment.<br><br>But in that moment, the human slipped away, and everything changed. He didn\u2019t process the next few moments as excruciating pain suddenly surged through him and he helplessly watched his skin melt away. With a terrible shriek, Hux chased Gabe through a wall of darkness to make sure every last reminder of the species that had created him was erased from existence.",

		"story": "Olivia\u2019s master\u2019s thesis was on urban legends and their origins. She believed they shared similarities with traditional folklore and picked one to illustrate her point. The Unknown was believed to be a mysterious evil so heinous that investigating it almost immediately invited death. At least that was how the story went. And there were many stories. One story was of a woman in Greenville who disappeared without a trace on stage in front of a room full of witnesses. Her friend disappeared weeks later while trying to investigate what happened. The police were stumped. They had no clues or leads, and that mystery created the perfect storm for amplifying and spreading an urban legend.<br><br>Instead of going back home for spring break, Olivia headed to Greenville to investigate. She drove to the second-cheapest motel in town and began to set up in a small room that smelled of cigarette smoke, mold, and booze. She turned one wall into a kind of evidence board. She taped up articles and various theories on similar disappearances attributed to The Unknown throughout the country. She made connections with red string and yellow thumbtacks. Anyone walking into the motel room would think she had lost her mind.<br><br>There were many theories as to The Unknown\u2019s origin. Some said it was a malevolent entity conjured long ago by an ancient cult. Others believed it to be an alien that escaped from Area 51. Legend was it thrived in darkness and stole the voices of those it consumed so as to lure others to their doom.<br><br>The first newspaper articles Olivia found referenced a disappearance at a s\u00e9ance held in the 1800s. In the late 1950s, several college students mysteriously disappeared from a movie theater. Witnesses saw them go inside. Some remembered seeing them in their seats. But when the lights came up, they were gone. No one saw them leave. No trace of them was ever found. A projectionist claimed to have heard voices in the empty darkness of the theater later that night. But when he turned on the lights, no one was there. Then in the 1960s a group of teens disappeared while exploring an abandoned hospital believed to be haunted.<br><br>Stories and speculation arose to explain these mystifying disappearances. Some talked about a top-secret government research program run by the Office of Strategic Services in the 1950s. Project Apple-Pie. Mind control experiments using hallucinogenic drugs. Most of the records were destroyed in the '70s, but witnesses claim that experiments were performed on unsuspecting civilians in various settings and locations throughout the country, including movie theaters, hospitals and universities. Many believed these unethical experiments opened doorways to other dimensions which allowed evil things to enter the world.<br><br>Olivia wrote observations to pin to her evidence board. The Unknown dwells in darkness and can mimic its victims. Was it an evil entity? An extraterrestrial? A failed government experiment? Or just a garden variety serial killer allergic to publicity? She wanted to prove The Unknown was nothing more than modern-day folklore. And that investigation led here to this night, to this place, to this shabby motel room.<br><br>Yet she couldn\u2019t help but notice that the disappearances in Greenville included one detail the other stories didn\u2019t. The fog. And she half-remembered another urban legend with a thick, unnatural fog that somehow made people disappear. Maybe, she mused, the Greenville disappearances didn\u2019t relate to The Unknown but some other darkness.<br><br>For a moment Olivia wondered what would happen if one urban legend encountered another. She laughed at the idea and tempted fate by sketching a picture of what she thought The Unknown might look like. Then she pinned the sketch right in the middle of her evidence board, laughed nervously and waited to be consumed by The Unknown for having tried to define it. Anxiously, she stared at the windows and front door for seconds that turned to minutes and minutes that turned to hours.<br><br>But nothing happened.<br><br>Now it was after 2AM and Olivia was exhausted as she examined the articles and sipped cold coffee. So, when she first heard the whisper, she wondered if she imagined it.<br><br>\u201cOlivia\u2026\u201d<br><br>It seemed to come from the bathroom.<br><br>\u201cHelp\u2026\u201d<br><br>The lights in the room flickered.<br><br>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d<br><br>Olivia stared with wide eyes at the closed door of the bathroom. Her mind was playing tricks on her. Or\u2014<br><br>Her friends had shown up to prank her.<br><br>\u201cAriella? Sean? Stop messing around\u2026\u201d<br><br>The lights continued to flicker as she edged closer to the bathroom. Fear spread in long waves through her, and a terrible realization bloomed within her that The Unknown was behind the bathroom door, was preparing to make her pay for her hubris. Something began to whisper her name again. But then the voice rose, cracked, and distorted in sudden panic as if the brooding creature behind the door were under attack.<br><br>An unknown horror filled Olivia\u2019s heart and left room for nothing else. She breathed deeply as cold sweat beaded on her forehead. She placed her hand on the doorknob. The lights turned off, but she could still hear the strangely inhuman cries. Then the lights turned back on, and she could see a strange black fog seeping through the bottom of the door.<br><br>Hesitantly, Olivia creaked the door open to see a bulky shape with frenzied tentacles being pulled into a thick mass of fog, vanishing slowly into the darkness like a dying shadow. The shrieking stopped suddenly, neighbors banged on the wall to turn down the TV, and Olivia stared intently at the black abyss that yawned before her. She wasn\u2019t sure what to do. Part of her wanted to run. But the other part wanted to know more. And as she considered what to do next, dozens of voices began to call out to her with promises of the unknown and the impossible and of unearthly things beyond human experience.",

Few dare speak his true name, for fear that he may hear\u2014or worse.<br><br>Even as a young wizard, Vecna\u2019s command of magic was matched by none. While others spent decades committing to and perfecting one school of magic, he effortlessly mastered each one of them.

Over the centuries, he shed his mortal shell and ascended to lichdom. His power gave rise to a great empire, ruled over from his Rotted Tower.<br><br>His thirst for dark knowledge to fill his Book of Vile Darkness led him to many realms and planes. But it was in his own realm one of his servants found something\u2014a spell, perhaps, torn from an ancient tome\u2014written in a language he had never seen. From it he could sense an incredible dark energy. Without any document of the language, he had to spend months painstakingly analyzing its syntax, its phonetics, its form. He documented every stroke of every letter, scrutinizing and theorizing on their meanings, in a massive book hidden in his chambers. When his lieutenants came to him with problems in their domain, Vecna told them to deal with it themselves. He had more important matters to attend to.<br><br>Countless nights were spent memorizing the strange script, attempting to make it make sense. Only occasionally would he leave his keep to investigate rumors of people who had disappeared without a trace in the night. At these scenes, he could sense the same foreign magic that emanated from the torn page. He was convinced that whatever was killing these people had also written this strange script.<br><br>He was confounded, which made him furious. The scenes, few and far between, had no pattern, no common motive. No sign of struggle, no body, and only a lingering hum of dark energy. To what end did they need these bodies?<br><br>One dark night, he had a breakthrough: a word he had been interpreting as \u201cdying\u201d made more sense as \u201cdisappearing.\u201d Perhaps these people were not being killed at all: perhaps they were being taken alive. He applied this substitution through his notes and everything seemed to fall into place.<br><br>He copied what he had learned to a fresh piece of parchment, written phonetically. He began to speak the words aloud and the room darkened. It filled with a creeping black fog. He felt himself displacing, going somewhere else. Vecna resisted, incanting memorized spells, holding the fog at bay. But as he gazed into the darkness, he felt that alluring energy from it; a despair, an evil he could scarcely imagine. A sick curiosity overcoming him, he dropped his concentration, and let the fog take him. Whatever it was, wherever it was, he understood that the only way to harness it was to submit to it. He knew, in his cold, unbeating heart, that its dark secrets would one day be his.",
